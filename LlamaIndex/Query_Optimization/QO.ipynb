      "Risk Analysis:\n",
      "Apple's 10-K filing highlights two major risk factors:\n",
      "1. Global supply chain challenges: Apple relies on a complex global supply chain to manufacture and distribute its products. Disruptions due to geopolitical issues, natural disasters, or pandemics can significantly impact Apple's operations and financial performance.\n",

      "- The risks associated with global supply chain challenges and foreign exchange rates should be considered when evaluating Apple as an investment opportunity.\n",
      "- Apple's continued growth in the services segment and record iPhone sales demonstrate the company's ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions.\n",
