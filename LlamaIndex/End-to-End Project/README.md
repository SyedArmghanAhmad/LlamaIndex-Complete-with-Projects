Built using **LlamaIndex**'s advanced features, this system demonstrates professional-grade implementation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for financial analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies & Concepts Implemented

### 1. **Multi-Source Document Ingestion Pipeline**

- **Problem**: Financial data comes from various sources (PDFs, synthetic data, user uploads) with different formats
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented a flexible `FinancialDataLoader` class handling PDF parsing with metadata preservation
  - Used `SentenceSplitter` for intelligent chunking (1024 tokens with 200 token overlap)
  - Converted all documents to standardized `TextNode` format with metadata inheritance
- **LlamaIndex Concepts**:
  - `Document` and `TextNode` abstraction
  - Metadata propagation across nodes
  - Custom document loaders with chunking

### 2. **Hybrid Search System**

- **Problem**: Financial queries require both semantic understanding and precise term matching
- **Solution**:
  - Combined **BM25** (keyword search) with **vector embeddings** (semantic search)
  - Implemented **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** for score combination
  - Used `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` embeddings optimized for financial text
- **LlamaIndex Concepts**:
  - `BM25Retriever` for keyword search
  - `VectorStoreIndex` for semantic search
  - Custom retrieval pipelines with score fusion

### 3. **Versioned Index Management**

- **Problem**: Financial analysis requires audit trails and version control
- **Solution**:
  - Created `VersionedIndex` system with snapshot capabilities
  - Implemented commit/rollback functionality
  - Tracked metadata including document counts and company coverage
- **LlamaIndex Concepts**:
  - `StorageContext` persistence
  - Index versioning patterns
  - Document store management

### 4. **Quality Validation Framework**

- **Problem**: Need to ensure consistent, high-quality financial analysis
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented response validation with 6 required sections
  - Created scoring system (0-1 scale) evaluating:
    - Completeness
    - Citation count
    - Risk assessment presence
    - Recommendation quality
  - Built analytics dashboard tracking metrics over time
- **LlamaIndex Concepts**:
  - Response evaluation patterns
  - Prompt engineering for structured output
  - Analysis post-processing

### 5. **Financial-Specific Prompt Engineering**

- **Problem**: Generic responses lack financial rigor
- **Solution**:
  - Created specialized prompt template with:
    - Executive summary requirements
    - Leadership structure analysis
    - Risk scoring (1-5 scale)
    - Documentary evidence citations
    - Comparative analysis
    - Actionable recommendations
  - Added professional formatting requirements
- **LlamaIndex Concepts**:
  - `PromptTemplate` usage
  - Domain-specific prompting
  - Structured output control

### 6. **Production-Grade Monitoring**

- **Problem**: Need visibility into system performance
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented `QueryMonitor` tracking:
    - Latency metrics
    - Result counts
    - Query patterns
  - Built comprehensive dashboard with:
    - Time series charts
    - Performance metrics
    - Correlation analysis
- **LlamaIndex Concepts**:
  - Query analytics patterns
  - Performance optimization
  - Production monitoring
