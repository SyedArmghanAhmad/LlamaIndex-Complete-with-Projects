However, clinical integration of AI is already well-underway. Many authors have recently reported on the AI knowledge and perceptions of radiologists/medical staff and students however there is a paucity of information regarding radiographers. Published literature agrees that AI is likely to have signi cant impact on radiology practice. As radiographers are at the forefront of radiology service delivery, an awareness of the current level of their perceived knowledge, skills, and con dence in AI is essential to identify any educational needs necessary for successful adoption into practice.\nAim: The aim of this survey was to determine the perceived knowledge, skills, and con dence in AI amongst UK radiographers and highlight priorities for educational provisions to support a digital healthcare ecosystem.\nMethods: A survey was created on Qualtrics  and promoted via social media (Twitter /LinkedIn ). This survey was open to all UK radiographers, including students and retired radiographers. Participants were recruited by convenience, snowball sampling. Demographic information was gathered as well as data on the perceived, self-reported, knowledge, skills, and con dence in AI of respondents. Insight into what the participants understand by the term  AI  was gained by means of a free text response.\n1\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nQuantitative analysis was performed using SPSS  and qualitative thematic analysis was performed on NVivo .\nResults: Four hundred and eleven responses were collected (80% from diagnostic radiography and 20% from a radiotherapy background), broadly representative of the workforce distribution in the UK. Although many respondents stated that they understood the concept of AI in general (78.7% for diagnostic and 52.1% for therapeutic radiography respondents, respectively) there was a notable lack of suf cient knowledge of AI principles, understanding of AI terminology, skills, and con dence in the use of AI technology. Many participants, 57% of diagnostic and 49% radiotherapy respondents, do not feel adequately trained to implement AI in the clinical setting. Furthermore 52% and 64%, respectively, said they have not developed any skill in AI whilst 62% and 55%, respectively, stated that there is not enough AI training for radiographers. The majority of the respondents indicate that there is an urgent need for further education (77.4% of diagnostic and 73.9% of therapeutic radiographers feeling they have not had adequate training in AI), with many respondents stating that they had to educate themselves to gain some basic AI skills. Notable correlations between con dence in working with AI and gender, age, and highest quali cation were reported.\nConclusion: Knowledge of AI terminology, principles, and applications by healthcare practitioners is necessary for adoption and integration of AI applications. The results of this survey highlight the perceived lack of knowledge, skills, and con dence for radiographers in applying AI solutions but also underline the need for formalised education on AI to prepare the current and prospective workforce for the upcoming clinical integration of AI in healthcare, to safely and ef ciently navigate a digital future. Focus should be given on different needs of learners depending on age, gender, and highest quali cation to ensure optimal integration.\nKeywords: arti cial adoption\nintelligence, AI, radiography, education, workforce training, digital health, radiotherapy,\nINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\nThe AI Accelerating Trajectory In the last decade, Arti cial Intelligence (AI) implementation has accelerated but has also become an increasingly divisive topic in medicine, particularly so within medical imaging. The development of more sophisticated computers with greater storage capabilities and faster graphics processing units (GPUs) have allowed systems architectures to develop in a way which was not possible before (1). This has allowed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image recognition tasks to develop. These systems learn iteratively until acceptable performance is achieved relative to the previous interpretive standard (2). Wider availability of imaging datasets and advancements in neuroscience further perpetuated AI technology advancement (3).\nlarge medical\nWhile AI is considered to be a promising, fast changing area of healthcare innovation (4), able to revolutionise care is often seen with suspicion and mistrust by delivery, many healthcare professionals working in radiology, leaving them concerned about their future careers (5 7). In response to the impending digital healthcare revolution, the NHS has\nit\nprioritised the development, testing, and validation of AI tools anddigitalhealthsystemsaspartoftheirlong-termimprovement plan (8).\nAI Implementation Creates Controversy Among Medics, Including Radiologists Despite these technological advances, implementation of AI into the clinical setting has been perceived di erently across the multidisciplinary team. Di erence research projects surveyed radiologists and radiology trainees, the medical practitioners within medical imaging. In 2019, Waymel et al. (9) surveyed 270 senior radiologists and radiology registrars in France and reported an optimistic view as clinicians felt that implementation of AI will have a positive impact on clinical practise. Respondents thoughtthatAIwillspeedupreportingturnaroundtimes,i.e.,the time taken to produce a clinical diagnostic report, with a possible reduction in the number of imaging-related medical errors and subsequent increased contact time to enable more direct patient care. Further work by Oh et al. in Korea (10), surveyed the con dence of 669 doctors and medical students when using AI, where 62% of respondents reiterated the perception that AI\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n2\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\nwould speed the collection of clinical data. In Germany, 83% of 263 surveyed medical students felt that AI will never replace the radiologist (11) however this is contradicted by reports ranging from 26 to 78% of respondents (doctors, nurses, and technicians) fearing that AI could replace them in their clinical role (10 13). A lack of trust and acceptance of AI systems is also apparent in the literature (14, 15) with results in Korea reporting that 79% of respondents would always favour the doctor s opinion over the AI when a con ict arose. Whilst in Germany (10), 56% of 263 surveyed medical students, stated that AI would not be able to establish a de nitive diagnosis (11). The perceived advantages of AI in the current evidence-base are clear; however contradictory views exist internationally on how exactly AI will work in the clinical arena and whether it will lead to role depletion among physicians/healthcare workers and students.\nThe AI Training Gap May Challenge AI Implementation Among Clinicians and Perpetuate Long-Standing Workforce Shortages The majority of published literature has further highlighted a lack of training to empower healthcare practitioners to optimally use the capabilities of AI, as well as the lack of regulatory frameworks of AI-enabled healthcare products (16, 17) and lack of thorough scrutiny of reported studies, ensuring a robust knowledge base (18). The majority of physicians feel they have received insu cient previous information on AI and would consider attending continuous medical education or technically advanced training on AI, if available (9 12). Similarly medical students have reported either no AI training at all or insu cient training in AI with many believing it should be taught at undergraduate level and be part of the compulsory curriculum (11, 19).\nLack of adequate training on AI to prepare clinicians and explain basic AI concepts and applications may impact on the number of physicians choosing to specialise in radiology after graduation, as was highlighted by recent research in the UK (20). A total of 19 medical schools participated in a survey assessing attitudes of medical students toward AI, 49% of respondents reported that they would be less likely to consider specialising in radiologyduetotheimpactofAI.Asimilarpictureisemergingin the United States, where 44% of 156 survey respondents reported they would also be less likely to choose radiology as a specialty due to the in uence of AI (13).\nThe lack of knowledge of AI bene ts and risks and the skills gap on using AI tools by clinicians needs to be urgently addressed to cater for the workforce shortages in medical imaging and radiotherapy; the current Royal College of Radiologist statistics which state that  the NHS radiologist workforce is now short- sta ed by 33% and needs at least another 1,939 consultants to meet safe sta ng levels and pre-coronavirus levels of demand for scans  (20). This sta ng shortage in medical imaging is further compounded by the College of Radiographers census of the diagnostic radiography workforce in the UK. Results reported that the average current UK vacancy rate across respondents was 10.5% at the census date of 1 November 2020 (21). It is\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n3\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nimperative to use dedicated educational provisions to dispel the misperception that  AI will replace radiology sta , or that AI may deter sta  from specialising in the role in the  rst place.  Further training is required not only on how to use AI itself but also on the advantages, challenges, and issues surrounding AI implementation into clinical departments to ensure the con dence of clinicians interested into these careers increases.\nThe Impact of AI on Radiographers Radiographers are registered healthcare professionals who work predominantly and directly with patients, families, carers, and service users but very closely with Radiologists. In the UK, diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers form the largest proportion of the workforce in clinical imaging (radiology) and radiotherapy departments, respectively. There are more than 30,000 members of the radiographers  professional body, the Society of Radiographers (SoR) (2020) (22), and 36,941 currently registered with the regulator for health and care professions, the Health and Care Professions Council in the UK (23). Collectively their roles encompass the provision of health screening services, clinical imaging for diagnosis, and imaging and therapeutic services to facilitate curative, palliative, surveillance, end of life, and forensic examinations. Radiographers interact with and care for thousands of people each day. This requires a wide and encompassing range of skills and knowledge and the ability to empower people in shared decision making. Radiographers work on the interface between technology and service users in clinical imaging and radiotherapy. They operate the equipment, produce, and report on diagnostic images.\nRadiology and radiography, two interconnected but distinct professions, are traditionally considered to be early adopters of AI technology (24, 25), with computerised diagnosis used as early as the 1960s (8). Since then, there have been several periods of high activity in AI research and development with intervening periods of lower activity, so-called AI  winters  (26, 27). Pattern recognition computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tools have been part of mammography image interpretation since the 1980s (28, 29), some of which are extant today and perpetuate signi cant human input due to high false positive rates (14, 30).\nWhile research related to radiologists  roles, clinical practise, and education in relation to AI has  ourished, as discussed in the abovementioned paragraphs, very little research has considered the impact of AI on radiographers and their perception of using it in clinical practise. The limited literature available would suggest that radiographers are keen to engage with AI but controversy still exists whereby some radiographers feel that AI may deplete or threaten their jobs in the future whilst others think it may lead to more advanced role developments (31 34). Abuzaid et al. (35) surveyed the opinions of 34 radiologists and 119 radiographers in the UAE on their willingness to accept AI into practise. Sta  were excited and ready to embrace AI, however 17% of respondents stated they had no knowledge of AI, 40% were self- taught, and 73% reported di culty accessing training courses to  ll the knowledge gap for sta . Further work by Botwe et al. (36) surveyed 151 radiographers in Ghana. Most respondents (83%) were positive and would embrace the implementation of AI into practise, however 83% expressed concerns about AI related\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\nerrors and job displacement. A further 69% felt that AI could lead to reductions in radiation dose whilst maintaining image quality. Overall, they concluded that there was a need for further education for radiographers to alleviate these fears. Similar fears andapprehensionsregardingtrustandknowledgegapshavebeen expressed by radiographers in Canada, America, and Ireland (32 34). In particular the survey of 318 diagnostic and 77 therapeutic radiographers from Ireland has identi ed resistance of AI use in particular for patient facing roles. Respondents felt that radiographers would always have a primary role when caring for the patient and that AI would not be able to replace that human touch. Similar to other studies, >50% respondents worried about changing roles and fewer jobs for radiographers, as AI will take over clinical delivery. However this notion of role depletion was not universally supported in this survey as 47% of diagnostic and 38% of therapeutic radiographers felt AI will create new specialised/advanced roles in the future. This may mean the radiographers can work together with AI tools to ful l roles that address the ongoing sta  shortages.\nThe Future of AI Within Medical Imaging and Radiotherapy: Challenges and Opportunities for Integration and the Importance of Education Sarwar et al. (37) have predicted the full integration of AI in healthcare in the next 5 10 years. Implementation of AI into the clinical setting is not without barriers; these include a lack of trust and acceptance of the systems o ered (9, 29), lack of training to empower healthcare practitioners to optimally use the capabilities of AI, as discussed above, the lack of standardised regulatory frameworks of AI enabled healthcare products (10, 12) and lack of thorough scrutiny of reported studies, ensuring a robust knowledge base (15) to name just a few. It is essential for the design, validation, and adoption of AI that radiographers are knowledgeable, competent, con dent, and well-trained to be able to fully materialise the bene ts of new technology while minimising risks but also to be in position to explain these bene ts and risks to the patients; thus radiographers could be contributing to and sustaining of a safe, e cient medical imaging and radiotherapy service, one that is based on trust and research evidence on the use of appropriate AI technology.\nA number of suggestions to allow AI systems to make their way into clinical application have been o ered, such to make AI more interpretable or as various measures explainable (38, 39). The users of AI technologies, for instance the radiographers, radiologists, and oncologists and those responsible for the procurement of AI for healthcare, need to have adequate knowledge, and understanding of the functionality and applications of the proposed systems to enable unbiased selection, i.e., the best application choice for the intended function with an awareness of potential limitations and risks.\nThe Topol review (40) reiterates the need for education in AI to be integrated into preregistration programmes, and for the necessity of upskilling the existing workforce in AI applications and technology. Recent draught HCPC guidelines (41) state that radiographers should  be aware of the principles of AI\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n4\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nand deep learning technology, and the methods of assessing the performance of AI algorithms  (p. 45). Recent recommendations and standards jointly delivered by the International Society of Radiographers and Radiological Technologists (ISRRT) and EuropeanFederationofRadiographerSocieties(EFRS)(42),state that radiographers need to have functional and performance assessment knowledge of AI systems. This can be described as a form of  AI literacy  that should be included in both pre and post registration programmes, along with education for the whole workforce. The Society and College of Radiographers  AI Working Party has also recently o ered recommendations for education and training of radiographers on AI theory and applications (43).\nRationale, Aims, and Objectives information available on radiographers The paucity of perceptions of AI implementation into daily clinical practise provides a strong rationale for the design of a dedicated study. As identi ed by Lai et al. (44) AI in healthcare will only be accepted and satisfactory for everyone, if we invest on collaborative e ort and include everyone within the multidisciplinary team in the decision- to making process. Hence, highlight skills, the perceived, and con dence of UK diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers in relation to AI. Further objectives were to investigate available training provisions the and to propose content and format of further education on AI.\nand its\nthis exploratory study aims self-reported, knowledge,\nadequacy of\ncurrently\nMETHODS\nQuestionnaire Design A questionnaire was designed using the Qualtrics R(cid:13) survey platform. This is an online survey builder which allows for open dissemination via an internet link, hence optimising participant reach (45). This voluntary, fully online survey was designed and reported to adhere to the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) (46) and approved by City, University of London, School of Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee (ETH1920-1989). No incentives were o ered to complete this survey.\nThis was a fully open survey, available from the 12th of February 2021 to the 6th of April 2021, for everyone who had the link. The survey was set to collect fully anonymous responses, therefore neither identifying information was collected from participants. An opening slide gave participants information on the study rationale and aim, provided information on current literature on the subject, informed participants of the approximate time commitment to complete the survey and gained consent to proceed. A  nal survey slide noti ed respondents of submission of responses, although a full review of responses was not given. Participants were permitted to freely navigate back to previous questions and allowed to save responses and  nish the survey at a later time in order to maximise response completeness. All responses were\nIP addresses nor any other\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\nincluded in data analysis, even if the survey was not complete. Time for completion of the survey was, therefore, not analysed.\nThe questions included in the survey were loosely based on a previous, unpublished, survey undertaken by one of the co- authors. These initial survey was further modi ed and expanded listed authors, with new questions based on input from all many of whom are members of the  Society and College of Radiographers Arti cial Intelligence Working Party,  who have a range of senior clinical and academic experience. The survey content is drawing upon current research evidence as outlined in introduction, as well as from the themes presented on the Society of Radiographers (SCoR) AI guidance document for radiography professionals (43).\nThe Survey Instrument The questionnaire consisted of 91 questions in total, divided into  ve main sections or  blocks (i) participant demographics, (ii) AI knowledge, (iii) skills and con dence in AI (including questions on education provision), (iv) perceptions of the impact of AI on clinical practise (v) expectations for the future of radiography with AI and  nally, (vi) the e ect AI may have on image perception and reporting. Most questions were either multiple choice format, with some free text options to allow for more detailed responses or Likert scale questions. Only one question required a fully open response.\nThe demographic section included seven questions to gather data on the age, number of years  experience, highest academic quali cation, region of the UK, clinical setting, and nature of current role. This information was requested to allow investigation of any relationship between these independent variables and dependent variables of knowledge, skills and con dence in AI. An eligibility  ltering question placed at the beginning of the survey enquired if the respondent was a practisingorstudentradiographer;thiswastoensurethatanyone other than a radiographer did not complete the survey. If the participant responded that they are not a radiographer, they were redirected to the end of the survey and no further data was collected.\nOnly the results of the  rst three sections of the survey (i iii) are discussed in this paper; the remaining will be presented in di erent publications given space limit and richness of  ndings.\nValidity and Reliability of the Survey Instrument For each new survey face and content validity are vital measures of quality (47).\nFace and Content Validity Face validity, a subjective measure which concerns whether or not the instrument appears to potential test takers to be assessing what it intended to measure (48) has been assessed and ensured for our study (in terms of feasibility, readability, consistency of formatting, the clarity of the language used), through the piloting phase of the survey (49). Content validity,  the degree to which items in an instrument re ect the content universe to which the instrument will be generalised  (50) was ensured by the design and review of this work by the SCoR AI\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n5\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nworking party and other AI radiography experts, the piloting with another team of AI experts with varying demographics and professional backgrounds and by being grounded on relevant research evidence, including the SCoR AI guidance document for radiographers, which outlined priorities for AI adoption within the radiography workforce in all areas of practise, including education (43). The validation of the questionnaire was conducted by a panel of experts in the medical imaging and AI  eld, which included 12 quali ed, practising radiographers, academics, students, and clinical sta , with a range of clinical experience from <1 year to >20 years. This tested both the technical aspects of the survey format (face validity) as well as the suitability of the questions (content validity). Minor formatting issues involving di culty in navigating to the next question were reported and  xed before  nal dissemination of the survey.\nInternal Consistency Cronbach s alpha was calculated post-hoc for the Likert scale questions of this instrument to be able to con rm internal consistency (47). Acceptable internal reliability was found for the scale questions for both professions (  = 0.736 and   = 0.777 for diagnostic and therapeutic radiography, respectively).\nParticipants This survey was intended to give a national (UK) perspective on perception of knowledge, skills, con dence, and educational needs of both the diagnostic radiography and therapeutic radiography workforce in the  eld of AI. All radiographers (student and trainees, practising and retired, academic, and researchers) across all including sonographers, were invited to participate. The survey was disseminated via LinkedIn R(cid:13) and Twitter R(cid:13) employing non- probability snowball, sampling (51), and widely shared by the authors through their radiography-speci c professional networks, many of whom are members of the SCoR AI Working Party or hold di erent AI leadership positions within decision making agencies. Academic colleagues were also approached to distribute within radiography communities and students.\nsub-specialisation areas,\nacademic\nto the leads of many clinical centres throughout the UK for dissemination to all colleagues, therefore ensuring maximum reach to relevant parties.\nThe link to the survey was also sent\nData Analysis the The IBM SPSS (version 23) was used for analysis of data (52). Descriptive statistics, in the form of frequencies have been reported for most of the responses. One question required an open-ended response, which has been analysed by thematic content analysis, using NVivo (version 12) (53). Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated using SPSS and graphs produced within MS Excel R(cid:13) (Microsoft, 2018). Data was presented in percentages for single response questions and counts/frequency for questions where more than one response was permitted. There were no weightings applied to any questions for analysis.\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\nCombinations of some of the variables have been analysed to determine if any patterns emerged in order for hypotheses to be proposed for future studies (54). The correlations of independent variables such as: years practising, highest academic quali cation, and age with dependent variables such as: understanding of AI, con dence in AI, understanding of the underlying terminology of AI, feelings of being well-trained in AI, and agreement that they have developed some skill in AI, were all explored and measured on either four-point or seven-point Likert scales, with the exception of  understanding of AI,  which was measured on a scale of zero to ten. Spearman s rank (rs) and Kendall s tau-b (v) correlations between ordinal data were run using IBM SPSS R(cid:13) (55). Responses which did not  t with the ordinal classi cation of the data were recategorised as  missing  before calculation, such as level of highest quali cation option  other  and years  experience options  I do not work in the clinical setting  and  I am in retirement.  Missing data were excluded pairwise, meaning that data could be included even if the respondent did not enter a response to some other question. Bootstrapping was activated for 1,000 samples at 95% con dence levels. Subgroup analysis was then carried out to better understand the reason for any statistically signi cant correlations between ordinal data.\nChi-square test for independence was run for comparisons between nominal and ordinal data. In many cases, assumptions necessary to allow accurate interpretation of the Pearson s chi- square were found to be violated, so the  likelihood ratio Chi- square  statistic was used as an alternative. The likelihood ratio comparesthelikelihoodofobtainingtheobserveddatacompared to the likelihood of obtaining the data if there is no signi cant di erence in the variables, i.e., the data which would have been observed if there is no statistically signi cant relationship between variables (p   0.05) (56). Cramer s V (V) was then performed to quantify the magnitude of any relationship.\nThe resultant cross tabulations were interrogated to identify any major di erences between observed and expected counts within subgroups for signi cant  ndings. Subgroup analysis was then carried out to better understand the reason for any statistically signi cant correlations.\nThematic analysis using NVivo R(cid:13) was performed to analyse qualitative responses (52). Responses to the open-ended question  Can you describe the term Arti cial Intelligence in your own words?  were read and coded. Codes were reread and collated into four key themes.\nRESULTS\nDemographic Information Cleaning of the data removed any blank responses from the initial participants. A total of 415 radiographers responded to the survey. Four participants selected the option of  no consent,  leaving 411 survey responses for analysis.\nthey were practising diagnostic radiography (n = 273), 14.4% were diagnostic radiography students (n = 59), 16.1% stated they were practising therapeutic radiography (n = 66), and 2.7% were therapeutic radiography students (n = 11). This calculated to an approximate 1:4 ratio of therapeutic: diagnostic radiographers,\nOf\nthe total respondents, 66.4% stated that\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n6\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nwhich broadly represents the UK workforce ratio of 3,794 therapeutic to 20,231 diagnostic radiographers (57). The most recent data from the HCPC, stated above, is not broken down into diagnostic and therapeutic radiography (23). Two respondents indicated they were practising both diagnostic and therapeutic radiography.\nThere were responses from throughout the regions of the UK with the exception of therapeutic radiographers in the Channel Islands (Table 1).\nArangeofyearsofexperiencewasindicatedinbothdiagnostic radiography and radiotherapy. Visual inspection would indicate there is a similar distribution amongst respondents in each profession (Table 1).\nThere was representation across all age groups except for the\nover 65 years old group in radiotherapy (Table 1).\n(including students), 26% indicated they were male, 72.2% female, 0.6% non-binary/third gender, and 1.2% preferred not to say. This is similar to the radiotherapy respondents of whom 22.4% responded that they were male and 77.6% female, which is broadly representative of the UK radiographer workforce, which has an approximate 1:3 ratio of male to female (47).\nOf\nthe diagnostic\nradiography respondents\nHighest Academic Quali cation For both diagnostic radiography and therapeutic radiography, most respondents indicated their highest level of academic quali cation as a BSc, with 24.2 and 35.5%, respectively. There were fewer diagnostic radiographers who have attained a MSc (19.6 and 36.8%) or doctoral level quali cation (e.g., Ph.D., Ed.D.) (1.9 and 3.9%) than therapeutic radiographers, respectively. Those with A-level or equivalent are assumed to be student radiographers. This data is represented in full in Table 1. Those who selected  other  were asked for further explanation, with the majority of the respondents across both professions stating they hold a Diploma of the College of Radiographers (DCR) (n = 7). Other responses included conversion degrees such as MRad (n = 2), or other types of master s degrees such as MEd (n = 1) and MA (n = 2).\nClinical Setting The greatest proportion of participants from both professions indicated that they work in university teaching hospitals, closely followed by the district general hospital setting. Full details of other responses are given in Table 1.\nFor those who responded  other  in therapeutic radiography, two stated they worked in a foundation trust, three in a specialist cancer centre, two were students, and one stated they were a university lecturer. Most free text responses from the diagnostic radiography participants indicated that they worked in the university setting as either an academic or researcher (n = 15), followed by responses from students (n = 10).\nRole Description those in clinical practise from both professions Most of indicated that they were practising as a clinical radiographer (39.1 and 38.2%, diagnostic radiography and radiotherapy, followed by those choosing the  advanced respectively),\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\nTABLE 1 | Respondents  demographic details presented as percentages (%) and frequencies (n).\nDiagnostic radiography\nTherapeutic radiography\nRegion of UK where respondents currently work\nEngland\nScotland\nWales\n56.7 (n = 183)\n30 (n = 97)\n1.9 (n = 6)\n88.2 (n = 67)\n9.2 (n = 7)\n1.3 (n = 1)\nNorthern Ireland\n11.1 (n = 36)\n1.3 (n = 1)\nChannel Islands\n0.3 (n = 1)\n0 (n = 0)\nYears practising radiography\n0 2 years\n3 5 years\n22.7 (n = 75)\n10.6 (n = 35)\n23.4 (n = 18)\n16.9 (n = 13)\n6 10 years\n13.9 (n = 46)\n11.7 (n = 9)\n11 20 years >20 years\n23.0 (n = 76)\n27.5 (n = 91)\n23.4 (n = 18)\n22.1 (n = 17)\nNot practising\n1.2 (n = 4)\n1.3 (n = 1)\nRetired\n1.3 (n = 4)\n1.3 (n = 1)\nAge range\n18 25 years old\n19.3 (n = 63)\n23.7 (n = 18)\n26 35 years old\n28.4 (n = 93)\n26.3 (n = 20)\n36 45 years old\n27.2 (n = 89)\n25.0 (n = 19)\n46 55 years old\n12.5 (n = 41)\n18.4 (n = 14)\n56 65 years old >65 years old\n11.3 (n = 37)\n1.2 (n = 4)\n6.6 (n = 5)\n0 (n = 0)\nHighest academic quali cation\nA-level\nBSc\n14.9 (n = 48)\n24.2 (n = 78)\n11.8 (n = 9)\n35.5 (n = 27)\nPgCert\n19.9 (n = 64)\n1.3 (n = 1)\nPgDip\n13.0 (n = 42)\n6.6 (n = 5)\nMSc\n19.6 (n = 63)\n36.8 (n = 28)\nPhD/EdD/DProf or equivalent\n1.9 (n = 6)\n3.9 (n = 3)\nOther\n6.5 (n = 21)\n3.9 (n = 3)\nClinical setting/counts (respondents were permitted more than one selection)\nUniversity teaching hospital District general hospital\nn = 195\nn = 103\nn = 50\nn = 19\nPrivate sector\nn = 12\nn = 2\nPoly-trauma unit\nn = 30\nn = 0\nMobile unit\nn = 4\nn = 0\nOther\nn = 14\nn = 5\nI do not work in the clinical setting\nn = 25\nn = 4\nCurrent role\nAssistant practitioner radiographer\n1.2 (n = 4)\n0 (n = 0)\nUndergraduate radiography student\n19.6 (n = 63)\n13.2 (n = 10)\nClinical radiographer\n39.1 (n = 126)\n38.2 (n = 29)\nResearch radiographer\n0.9 (n = 3)\n2.6 (n = 2)\nAdvanced practitioner\n15.8 (n = 51)\n17.1 (n = 13)\nPh.D. researcher radiographer\n0.6 (n = 2)\n0 (n = 0)\n(Continued)\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n7\nTABLE 1 | Continued\nDiagnostic radiography sub- specialism/counts (respondents were permitted more than one selection)\nTherapeutic radiography sub- specialism/counts (respondents were permitted more than one selection)\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nDiagnostic radiography\nTherapeutic radiography\nOther\n3.1 (n = 10)\n6.6 (n = 5)\nAcademic in radiography: teaching only\n0.9 (n = 3)\n1.3 (n = 1)\nIndustry partner\n0.3 (n = 1)\n1 (n = 0)\nConsultant radiographer\n4.3 (n = 14)\n13.2 (n = 10)\nClinical academic/Lecturer: practitioner\n3.1 (n = 10)\n1.3 (n = 1)\nRadiology/ Radiographer/ Radiotherapy manager\n6.2 (n = 20)\n6.6 (n = 5)\nRetired radiographer\n0.9 (n = 3)\n0 (n = 0)\nAcademic in radiography: teaching and research\n3.7 (n = 12)\n0 (n = 0)\nGeneral radiography including emergency, theatre, and  uoroscopy\nn = 207\nMammography\nn = 32\nMRI\nn = 56\nCT\nn = 100\nUltrasound\nn = 25\nInterventional\nn = 44\nPET/CT\nn = 3\nPET/MRI\nn = 1\nDEXA/DXA\nn = 5\nReporting\nn = 63\nRadiology manager\nn = 20\nPACS administrator\nn = 9\nEducation\nn = 54\nPolicy maker/professional advocate\nn = 11\nOther (diagnostic)\nn = 22\nPre-treatment, simulation, contouring, immobilisation Treatment planning\nn = 35\nn = 15\nTreatment delivery\nn = 54\nPatient information/support/review\nn = 23\nEducator\nn = 7\nResearch\nn = 7\nManagement\nn = 10\nQuality assurance/Quality improvement\nn = 7\nDEXA/DXA clinical applications\nn = 0\nOther (therapeutic)\nn = 7\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\npractitioner  option (15.8% and 17.1%, diagnostic radiography and therapeutic radiography, respectively). There are fewer consultant radiographers responding to this survey in diagnostic than therapeutic radiography (4.3 and 13.2%, respectively), although it should be noted that there were more options available for the diagnostic radiography respondents. This was to best re ect the speci c career landscape in both professions (Table 1).\nArea of Expertise/Sub-Specialism Respondents were given the option of selecting up to three options from the list, along with a free-text option for further explanation. Most diagnostic radiographers indicated that they were involved in general radiography (32%) followed by CT (15%), followed closely by those working in reporting, MRI and education. The responses from respondents in the radiotherapy cohort indicated that the majority were involved in treatment delivery (33%), followed by pre-treatment, simulation, contouring, and immobilisation (21%) (Table 1).\nFrom those who selected  other  in diagnostic radiography, most responses were cardiac catheterisation (n = 4) and nuclear medicine (n = 3). Radiotherapy respondents indicated areas of sub-specialism in breast cancer (n = 1), research (n = 1), stereotactic radiosurgery (n = 1), and Information management and technology (n = 1).\nPerceived Knowledge, Skills, and Con dence in AI An understanding of perceived knowledge, skills and con dence in AI was sought through an open question, asking respondents to describe the term  arti cial intelligence  in their own words and a number of Likert-scale questions.\nUnderstanding of the Term  Arti cial Intelligence  Responses were initially coded using thematic analysis for each of the professions, resulting in 21 codes (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Figure 1).Most codeswere common acrossboth professions (Supplementary Figure 2). Four general themes emerged from thematic analysis: (i) clinical applications of AI, (ii) advantages of AI, (iii) disadvantages of AI, (iv) technical information of AI technology (Supplementary Table 1).\nThe top three most frequent codes in the responses from the\ndiagnostic radiographers  cohort included:\n(i)\n(ii)\nunderstanding of AI as used in the identi cation of pathology or abnormality (clinical applications), for example the following quotes are presented as relevant;  reporting, without a practitioner looking at the  lm.

Out of the other options presented, the majority in both professions indicated that any skill has been developed from their own, self-directed learning (21.0%). In both professions, the fewest responses came from the  CPD in a higher education establishment  option. The  other  option was selected by 40 respondents over the two professions. The diagnostic radiography respondents indicated that they have undertaken assignments or dissertations in AI (n = 8), have read around the subject or taken online courses (n = 4), have had\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n9\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nequipment training or in house training (n = 4), contributed to a research project conducted by someone else (n = 3), listened to presentations at conferences (n = 3), or had some form of AI training integrated into a postgraduate quali cation (n = 3). The radiotherapy comments included, workplace/applications training or through current use (n = 4), knowledge from a previous career (n = 1), and one respondent stated that they work for an AI company.\nCon dence in Using AI in Radiography the diagnostic radiography respondents indicated More of that than the radiotherapy respondents (yes, no, unsure) (78.7 and 52.1%, respectively)\nthey understood the term AI\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nFIGURE 3 | Respondents  perception of understanding of the term  arti cial intelligence  [(A), diagnostic radiography, (B) therapeutic radiography].\nFIGURE 4 | Respondents  perceived con dence in using AI technologies.\n(Figures 3A,B), although a slightly smaller percentage of diagnostic radiographers stated that they felt con dent in using AI technologies in radiography, compared to the radiotherapy responses (28.2 and 33.8% con dent or very con dent, respectively) (Figure 4). Respondents from both professions indicated a moderate understanding of AI and asked to rate it using a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 representing no knowledge at all and 10 representing  expert.  A mean response of 5.5 and 4.5 (0 10 scale) was reported for diagnostic radiography and radiotherapy, respectively.\nPerception of Availability of AI Training for Radiographers (Generic) The majority of respondents from both professions either disagree or strongly disagree with this statement, with a  disagreement  aggregate (somewhat disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree) of 77.4 and 73.9% and an agreement aggregate (somewhat agree, agree, and strongly agree) of only 6.7 and 6.1% for diagnostic and therapeutic radiography, respectively (Figure 5).\nPerceived Acquired Skills in AI and Training to Support These Skills Questions were posed to respondents regarding their perceived level of skill in AI, how they have developed this skill, the nature of any training they have received and how prepared they feel their skills or training has made them for the implementation of AI in the clinical setting.\nPerception of Adequacy of Training Provisions for AI Implementation Both professions to trained with over respondents strongly disagreed with this was only (Figure 6).\nindicated\nthey\nfeel well- AI, and radiography or statement.

This is similar to the radiotherapy responses (50.8 vs. 27.7%) (Figure 7).\nFuture Training Content and Format on AI-Enabled Technologies To determine the type of training and education requirements needed in radiography, two questions were asked. One question\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n11\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nsought to gather information on the content of any training  what topic areas radiographers felt should be included in any training delivered, and another question on how or in what format this training might be best delivered in.\nTopic Areas Needed for Training Most respondents from both professions indicated that they were interested in learning about potential applications of AI and AI technology, techniques, and terminology. Programming and computer science and AI development and entrepreneurship were not popular choices (Figure 8). The  other  option was chosen by 16 respondents from the diagnostic radiography cohort and mostly included comments suggesting uncertainty\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\nFIGURE 7 | Perceptions of having developed/learned some skill in AI.\nFIGURE 8 | AI education topic preferences.\naround what should be included. Two comments suggested that it is too early to consider any education in AI.\nTraining Format Preferences Most training would be best delivered as part of a preregistration degree programme. E- learning/webinars and study days also received a high proportion of the total responses. All options were selected by some respondents (minimum respondent frequency n = 92 counts) (Figure 9).

There was only one combination of variables which produced statistically signi cant results in both professions i.e., the relationship between highest level of academic quali cation and understanding of AI on a scale of 0 10, where a medium strength positive correlation was found in both professions (54). Sub-group analysis revealed that for both the diagnostic and therapeutic responses, there was a general downward trend in the lower rating of con dence (i.e., scoring 0 3) as level of academic quali cation increased, with the reverse apparent for the higher ratings of con dence (i.e., score of 7 10), i.e., as level of highest academic achievement increased, the number of respondents reporting higher levels of con dence increased.

Further analysis of the groups reveals that very few respondents across all categories are very con dent, or con dent enough and a general downward trend in the  not con dent at all  selection, i.e., as level of highest academic quali cation increased, from undergraduate to Ph.D./Ed.D./D.Prof.orequivalent,theproportionofrespondents they were  not con dent at all,  decreased indicating that (Supplementary Table 7).\nIn the diagnostic radiography responses,\nsigni cant, medium strength positive association (rs = 0.417, v = 0.313, n = 71, p = 0.01) was found in the radiotherapy responses between age and understanding of AI (scale 0 10) and respondents  years  experience and understanding of AI (scale 0 10) (rs = 0.437, v = 0.332, n = 70, p = 0.01).

Furthermore, as an exploratory study it would help provide direction for future targeted AI research projects in the under-researched  eld of radiography.\nthis workforce,\nPerceived Knowledge, Understanding, and Con dence Although a large proportion of both professions indicated that they understood AI in general, further speci c responses from both professions made it clear that respondents were not very con dent when using AI technologies. There was also a lack of understanding of the speci c terminologies used in modern AI, such as  algorithms,   deep learning,   data mining,   over- tting,  and  neural networks  (Figure 1). This may indicate that, perhaps, initial reported  con dence  was surrounding AI in general rather than AI in radiography and modern AI. Abuzaid et al. (35) surveyed radiographers and radiologists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and found that 40% of familiar with AI and a further 30% had merely a basic understanding. Other studies also report lack of that (58, 59). The understanding of AI amongst knowledge and understanding of AI at this level of detail is essential when engaging with literature around modern AI (60). Many applications of AI in medicine are currently in the development stage and therefore it is imperative for all clinicians to understand the literature in order to have a critical appreciation of the  potentials, pitfalls, and risks  of proposed technology as we move into the inevitable implementation phase (6).\nrespondents were not\nthere is a general radiologists\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n14\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nLevel of Skill and Importance of Education and Training A barrier to clinicians  con dence and understanding may be the dearth of education on the subject, with many radiographers in both diagnostic and therapeutic radiography stating that they do not consider themselves to have any skill in AI. Botwe et al. (36) conducted a survey of African radiographers on their perception of AI in diagnostic imaging and reported that 82.2% of 151 respondents felt that a lack of knowledge will be a signi cant barrier to the implementation of AI in the clinical setting. This is supported by the responses from our survey indicating that very few respondents felt that they were well-trained to implement AI and new technologies in the clinical setting and why both professions overwhelmingly agree that there is not enough education and training available in AI for radiographers (Figure 5). Abuzaid et al. (35) further support this in their survey of radiographers and radiologists in the UAEs, reporting that 74.5% of radiographers and radiologists responding to their survey had not studied AI as part of their degree, that 73.9% indicating that the availability of education and training will be a barrier to the implementation of AI and that 68.6% of clinical sta  lack even a basic understanding of the technology.\nradiography is an evidence-based, applied science profession our day-to-day learning is supported formally, and informally, through our clinical placement and later on clinical roles (61). This is evidenced by the number of respondents, who reported that, despite not always having been formally trained, they did have some skill in AI, indicating that they had to seek out their own learning (Figure 2) and that AI has started to permeate radiography practise. Abuzaid et al. (35) concur, with 39.9% of respondents to their survey being self-taught in AI. Radiographers tend to learn to work with the tools which are introduced into the clinical setting, perhaps without the time or resources to fully understand the technology (62). This may have implications when newer, more complex forms of AI are introduced, which need to be approached more critically due to complex systems architectures and whose method of decision making are not so humanly interpretable (2, 15, 38). Being in position to know the theory behind the practise will enable healthcare professionals and radiographers to query,  ag, escalate, and troubleshoot concerns in the functionality of AI ecosystems and intervene, as and when needed, with human intelligence, for the safety of the patients.\nAs\nSuggestions for the Type and Format of AI Learning The radiographers responding to the survey indicate they wish to have education on potential AI applications, technology (technique and terminology), patient centeredness with AI, AI ethics, AI standards (quality assurance and control), and work ow improvements. These are areas which, perhaps, the workforce foresees or even witnesses as being the most impacted by AI (63). These may also be the areas that radiographers feel they can more easily relate to, and grasp given their training at level 6 (Bachelor s level) to allow for a smoother transition into a new  eld. Other proposed topics included\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\napplied machine learning, programming and computer science, and AI development/entrepreneurship, although these subject choices were less popular. The above list of topics is similar to those identi ed in the literature as important for inclusion in AI curricula, although it is also suggested that a more  exible curriculum should be o ered to best suit the students  interest and current developments in the  eld (64, 65). A minority (2.5%) of respondents across both professions indicated that they had received training as part of a CPD programme in a higher education setting. This could lead to some national or global disparity and variability in the type and standard of education being delivered in AI knowledge in the future (35) and could impact speed and quality of AI adoption and implementation as well as job satisfaction. The development of a standardised or recommendedAIcurriculum,assuggestedforradiologytrainees, may provide a solution for this (16, 58, 59).\nthe best place for any AI training was in the pre-registration setting. This aligns to the HCPC Standards of with the proposed changes Pro ciency (radiographers) which highlight the necessity for all radiographers to have an awareness of both the principles of AI, and of the methods of assessment of performance of any AI algorithm (41). If accepted, these changes would make it essential that all HCPC registrants and aspiring registrants have this knowledge, and therefore this learning must be front-loaded in the radiography education, in both the pre-registration as well as post-registration stages. The Topol review (40) supports this by recommending that training in digital technologies and computer science should be integrated into undergraduate education for health care professionals. A systematic review by Schuur et al. (16) examines training opportunities in AI for radiologists and found that there was an overwhelming prevalence of short courses o ered, rather than those integrated fully into curricula, with education providers only involved in a limited capacity. Interestingly this is not fully supported in the results from our study which found that, although the respondents indicated they did not receive speci c training in AI, there was a statistically signi cant relationship between the level of highest academic quali cation and understanding of AI. This suggests that the higher the level of academic quali cation, the greater the perception of understanding in AI. In the absence of speci c AI training, this may be simply due to the way which postgraduate students are required to develop transferable skills as fully independent learners and the encouragement of those studying for higher academic quali cations to become agents of change and therefore actively investigate current and future developments (such as AI) for clinical practise themselves (66).\nThe respondents\nindicate that\nGender, Age, Quali cation, and Role Correlations in Arti cial Intelligence for Radiographers The results from the analysis of the nominal data indicated that there is a relationship between gender and con dence in using AI terminology across both professions. Further exploration into the reason for this relationship were investigated from the cross tabulations of the likelihood ratios. This found that, on the whole, the observed values (responses) from the male respondents\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n15\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nwere higher than the expected values for  con dent  and  very con dent  and thefemale respondents were generally the reverse. The reason for this is unclear, although it should be noted that there were fewer male respondents than female in both professions (approximately 1:3 male:female respondents from both professions, which is representative of the workforce gender distribution). Studies indicate that AI and computer science are male dominated  elds (67), with only 18% of authors at AI conferences are considered female and that in general, females are less con dent in using technology than males (68). This may be an issue for the radiography workforce, where there is a much greater proportion of females than males (57). This is in contrast to the radiology workforce demographics, where 60% of the workforce are male (69). According to the Dunner-Kruger e ect(64),self-reportedcon denceisnomeasureofcompetence. Apossibleexplanationforthelowercon dencescoresforwomen in our study may be due to the gender con dence gap and the tendency for women to think less favourably about their scienti c reasoning ability and underestimate their performance (65).\nStudies suggest that while there remains a gap in female perceived self-con dence in AI technology related terminology and tasks, there is no di erence in performance or accuracy between genders (70). Kim Nilsson writes in  Forbes,  that, to mitigateserviceinequalities,itisessentialthatthoseprofessionals working in AI are representative of the population for which the AI will be used (71). There therefore, may need to be more targeted investigation into the causes for this disparity to allow timely intervention in education, training, mentorship, and representation before further integration of AI into this female-dominated clinical setting.\nThe Digital Natives Report (72), a multi-generational survey of over 1,000 UK business decision makers reported that AI is used in the daily lives of those born after mid-1995, so-called  Generation Z,  the youngest participants in the survey. The report also found that those in this age category have a hunger for new technology and are comfortable using it. The  ndings from our survey support this by the relationship found between the diagnostic radiography respondents  role and the perception of adequacy of training available in AI. The greatest discrepancy between actual and expected responses, as determined by the likelihood ratio, noted was in the student radiography cohort, with three times as many responses than predicted disagreeing with the statement  There is enough training on AI currently available for radiographers.  Additionally, there was a relationship found between role and understanding of AI (yes, no and unsure responses available). Interrogation of the responses would indicate that student therapeutic radiographers were more likely than expected, based on the likelihood ratio, to respond that they did not understand AI, and less likely to respond  yes  (Supplementary Table 12). The young professionals, and radiography students, of today are ready to embrace technology and education providers and employers should be in a position to maximise this potential.\nA positive correlation between respondents  age and perceived con dence in AI and years practising and perceived con dence in AI was found in the radiotherapy responses, indicating that those in the younger age categories and those with fewer years  experience felt less con dent in AI, which to some extent\nNovember 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 739327\nRainey et al.\ncontradicts the literature referenced above. This may be due to progressively greater exposure to new technologies in the clinical setting over time (61). Also a positive correlation was found between con dence on AI tems and applications and highest academic degree, which suggests the need for a customised approach to AI learning provisions for di erent healthcare practitioners depending on the level of their prior knowledge, as expected.\nFinally, a correlation was also found between diagnostic radiographers  UK region and con dence in the terminology of AI, although interrogation of the crosstabulation revealed no apparent pattern (Supplementary Table 12).\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH\nThis exploratory study gathered responses from a diverse sample of diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers, focussing on the UK radiography workforce. The male to female ratio (1:3) and diagnostic-to-therapeutic radiographers ratio (4:1) within the survey are representative of the actual UK radiography workforce. However, given that the survey employs convenience sampling (53), the results cannot be generalisable to the wider UK radiography population. This might relate to selection bias in relation to IT literacy and interest and knowledge of AI, as the participants were invited from the professional networks of the co-authors, many of which are established academics and researchers in the AI  eld. In reality the results of this work may possibly underestimate the lack of knowledge, skills, and con dence about AI as the respondents may come from settings of more established AI cultures and environments. However, convenience sampling remains an inexpensive sampling method forhard-to-reachpopulations(53).Thesamplesizeandsampling method is also comparable with similar studies in the  eld of radiography in other countries (34, 35).\nLimited free response information was obtained as many of the questions required Likert-scale or closed type responses. The team is planning focus groups with purposive sampling to understand in greater depth the educational need and challenges faced with the upcoming integration of clinical AI.\nThe study is exploratory in nature to set the basis for future studies; hence a hypothesis was not used but an explicit aim with objectives was stated alluding to workforce readiness for AI adoption.\nFinally, the survey instrument used did not employ a validated knowledge, skills, con dence scale as the team wished to contextualise and customise the survey to the priorities and needs of the workforce and validated questionnaires do not o er that  exibility; instead survey questions were developed by professional experts to get the information required to inform practise change in educational provisions in the near future.\nIt is hoped that this study will provide some useful material for\nfuture studies to build on.\nCONCLUSION\nThe results the UK radiography workforce is not yet knowledgeable, appropriately\nfrom this\nsurvey demonstrate that\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org\n16\nAI-Related Survey of UK Radiographers\nskilled, con dent, or su ciently educated for full integration of modern AI into the clinical setting. Some of the workforce are resorting to educating themselves on AI using short courses online but there is a need to prioritise formalised education and mentoring at all levels of the profession. This should not discriminate against those who do not have or do not wish to have postgraduate quali cations but also should allow  exibility by availability of postgraduate and CPD provisions for those who wish to keep abreast of technological developments after graduation. Radiographers, as integral to patient care and as direct consumers of AI technologies, need to be educated to critically embrace the emerging technologies, to ensure optimal patient care and outcomes and to be able to lead the way toward an AI-enabled future in health care.\nRadiographers are usually the  rst and, many times, the only point of patient contact in medical imaging or radiotherapy service. Consequently, an imperative exists for all radiographers to be part of the conversation as equal members in the decision making and co-designers of any new AI technological developments in the clinical setting. In order to appropriately engage in these conversations, we need to have a workforce where all feel con dent and adequately educated to be able to have a critical appreciation of the technology, its capabilities, challenges, and risks. This should come naturally for the radiography workforce, which has been traditionally trained on the interface between technological innovation and patient care. This does not mean that radiographers need to become computer science experts; but it does mean that they should be in position to safely and expertly apply AI solutions in clinical practise, be able to meaningfully appraise, interpret, and apply the evidence from literature for the bene t of their patients and collaborate in the design of new AI solutions addressing clinical challenges. With this realised, the radiographic profession would in a position to procure, use, and validate the most clinically useful AI tools for the context and patient population within which they operate, and additionally, in uence the system interfaces to allow for optimal integration into current work ows.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nETHICS STATEMENT\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by City, University of London SHS REC.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in the clinical delivery of immunomodulatory compounds. The tumor microenvironment (TME), comprising macrophages, fibroblasts, and immune cells, plays a crucial role in immune response modulation. Nanoparticles, engineered to reshape the TME, have shown promising results in enhancing immunotherapy by facilitating targeted delivery and immune modulation. These nanoparticles can suppress fibroblast activation, promote M1 macrophage polarization, aid dendritic cell maturation, and encourage T cell infiltration. Biomimetic nanoparticles further enhance immunotherapy by increasing the internalization of immunomodulatory agents in immune cells such as dendritic cells. Moreover, exosomes, whether naturally secreted by cells in the body or bioengineered, have been explored to regulate the TME and immune-related cells to affect cancer immunotherapy. Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers, activated by pH, redox, and light conditions, exhibit the potential to accelerate immunotherapy. The co-application of nanoparticles with immune checkpoint inhibitors is an emerging strategy to boost anti-tumor immunity.

Hence, cancer immunotherapy has been introduced as a new mainstay to utilize the patient s own immune system in cancer cell eradication. The cancer immunotherapy concept can be categorized into immune checkpoints- targeted therapy and the adoptive transfer of manipu- lated immune cells. Both of these strategies contribute to improving the immune system s function in the iden- tification and eradication of cancer cells [2].

Another method is the adoptive transfer of cells, which uses genetically engineered cells such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells and others such as multi- potent mesenchymal stem cells to affect the expression of a specific cytokine and other features of cells [6, 7]. Since the promising application of immune checkpoint block- ade and CAR-T cell therapy, cancer immunotherapy has undergone significant advances. Cancer immunotherapy is now considered a powerful and innovative strategy in clinics compared to other conventional treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The most recent immunotherapeutic methods have utilized T cells for the induction of adaptive immune responses. On the other hand, studies have shown that a number of innate immune checkpoints with expression on the antigen- presenting cells (APCs) contribute to immune evasion. These checkpoints are capable of detecting and eradicat- ing tumor cells through phagocytosis and suppressing innate immune response. The first line of the immune defense system is provided by innate immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells that act as APCs. They induce pro-inflammatory reactions to foreign attacks and contribute to the repair of damaged tissues. The cancer cells are able to express a number of signals known as  do not eat me  signals through expres- sion of CD47 [8], CD24 [9], PD-L1 [10], the beta-2 micro- globulin ( 2M) subunit of MHC-I [11], stanniocalcin 1 (STC-1) [12] and GD2 [13] to evade the macrophage- mediated phagocytosis.\nThe application of cancer immunotherapy has been of importance in the treatment of both hematological and solid tumors [14]. In fact, immunotherapy has revolu- tionized cancer therapy, and it aims to apply immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy, and vaccines to finally target the immune-oncology cycle for improv- ing the activity of T lymphocytes in tumor suppression. All of these regimens should be applied in a cycle to accelerate the tumor antigen presentation by APCs [15]. APCs are the cells with the ability to capture, process, and present the exogenous antigens to T cells, and are primarily recognized through the expression of MHC- II and other co-stimulatory molecules. APCs are mainly comprised of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. There are also other cells with expression of MHC-II such as thymic epithelial cells. Moreover, there are also other kinds of cells, such as eosinophils and basophils, with the ability of MHC-II expression upon stimulation\n[16, 17]. Regarding solid tumors, antigen uptake and presentation are mainly performed by macrophages and dendritic cells [18]. Although macrophages are the prev- alent phagocytic cells in cancers, they lack the ability to migrate into lymph nodes and activate T cells [18]. Note- worthy, macrophages are considered a factor in impair- ing the T cell-mediated responses against tumors, and they reduce the response to immune checkpoint block- ade, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy [19, 20]. On the other hand, the dendritic cells have a significant ability in lymph node migration to induce T cells for immunity [18, 21 24]. Moreover, increasing evidence has shown the ability of tumor-resident dendritic cells to stimulate T cell-mediated anti-cancer immune response [18, 24 28]. However, it should be noted that macrophages and other cells in the TME, including fibroblasts, can exert carci- nogenic activity upon induction and their regulation is of importance for maximizing cancer immunotherapy [19, 29 36]. Stimulation of TME remodeling represents a beneficial strategy for cancer treatment and immuno- therapy [37 43]. Although a significant number of stud- ies advocate the potential of immunotherapy in cancer suppression [44 48], immunotherapy has faced its own problems, and the most prominent one is immune eva- sion. Regarding the mutations and dysregulation of molecular pathways in human tumors, the oncogenic pathways are activated, which can finally promote the survival of cancer cells and mediate their escape from cancer immunotherapy and immune surveillance.\nIn addition to immune resistance, current drugs used for cancer immunotherapy and TME remodeling lack targeting features. As a result, the nanoparticles have been introduced to facilitate anti-cancer immu- nity. Nanostructures can improve the retention time and provide the targeted delivery [49]. Furthermore, nanoparticles are capable of TME remodeling to dis- rupt an immunosuppressive environment. The distor- tion of blood vessels and high growth rate of tumor cells cause hypoxia in TME that mediates an immunosup- pressive environment, characterized by an increase in the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells, includ- ing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived sup- pressor cells (MDSCs), as well as secretion of a number of factors including vascular endothelial growth fac- tor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor   (TGF- ). As a result, the function of dendritic cells is suppressed and macrophages are polarized into M2 phenotype. The nanoparticles can be specifically developed to target TME components and disrupt the immunosuppressive TME to improve the function in cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, nanoparticles can be considered as nano-scale delivery systems for drugs [50]. They can selectively accu- mulate in tumor tissue and enhance the retention time of drugs. Moreover, nanostructures demonstrate enhanced\npermeability and retention (EPR) effect, improving their accumulation in tumor sites because of leaky tumor vas- culature and damaged lymphatic drainage [51, 52]. Fur- thermore, nanostructures can be functionalized with ligands, to specifically target the tumor and even the TME components [53 55]. As a result, nanoparticles have been introduced as new structures for potentiating cancer immunotherapy and overcoming immune evasion [56 63].\nAmidst the current challenges in cancer immunother- apy, the need for improving cancer immunotherapy, and the promise of nanoparticles, the use of targeting sys- tems has emerged as a novel strategy for immunotherapy enhancement and TME remodeling. The development of nanoparticles based on targeting TME and improv- ing cancer immunotherapy can strengthen the potential for tumor eradication. Since the TME modulators suf- fer from targeted action, it is preferred to use targeted non-scale delivery systems for the regulation of TME and improving cancer immunotherapy. The present review\nfocuses on the application of nanoparticles for TME remodeling and boosting cancer immunotherapy. The current review will first provide a comprehensive outline regarding TME components and then, immune evasion is discussed. Then, the potential of nanoparticles for TME re-education through targeting its components, includ- ing macrophages, is described. Moreover, biomimetic nanoparticles and their stimuli-responsive kinds for bet- ter tumor targeting are described. Since exosomes have emerged recently in cancer immunotherapy, the role of exosomes, both endogenous and bioengineered, in the regulation of the immune system for tumor suppres- sion is discussed. Figure 1 provides an overview of using nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy.\nTumor microenvironment components Macrophages\nMacrophages, renowned for their phagocytic nature, play a crucial role in the immune system. They participate in various physiological processes, including development\nFig. 1 An overview of using nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy. The nanoparticles circulate in blood, and upon reaching the tumor site, they re- educate several tumor microenvironment components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages, to finally activate the immune system. Moreover, nanoparticles can stimulate immunogenic cell death to enhance the maturation of dendritic cells for the activation of immune cells, such as T cells, to enhance cancer immunotherapy. The co-application of nanoparticles with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1 blockers, can augment the potential of cancer immunotherapy\nand homeostasis. The phenotype and function of mac- rophages are intricately determined by their origin and polarization [64]. Initially believed to originate from hematopoietic stem cells and circulating monocytes [65], the recent studies reported that macrophages have an embryo-derived lineage, with precursors derived from erythro-myeloid progenitors in yolk sacs and fetal liver [65, 66]. Maintaining or enhancing the macrophage pop- ulation is essential for these cells to function effectively [67, 68]. There are two strategies for the replenishment of macrophages: monocyte recruitment and increased pro- liferation in the form of tissue-resident macrophages for elevating self-renewal ability [67, 69].\nIn the TME, macrophages are referred to as tumor- associated macrophages (TAMs), constituting 50% of the tumor mass [70]. The TAMs engage in intricate interac- tions not only with cancer cells but also with natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. The roles of TAMs extend to the regulation of cancer prolifer- ation, invasion, and angiogenesis [71 73]. Macrophages have also been associated with the development of resis- tance to cancer therapies [74]. The TAMs primarily origi- nate from the bone marrow or the yolk sac [75]. They can be polarized into two phenotypes. The M1 macrophages, induced by lipopolysaccharide and type 1 T helper cell (Th1)-derived exhibit pro-inflammatory and anti-cancer functions [76]. The M2 macrophages, induced by Th2-derived cytokines like interleukin-4 (IL- 4), IL-10, and IL-13, promote proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis [76]. A delicate balance exists between M1 and M2 macrophages in vivo, influencing tumorigenesis and treatment outcomes [77, 78]. The anti-inflammatory nature of M2 macrophages accelerates cancer progres- sion. The regulation of TAMs has been of importance for cancer immunotherapy. Currently, the strategies for targeting TMAs are based on controlling the ori- gin, functional polarization, and phagocytic function of TAMs. Moreover, macrophages and monocytes have been engineered to mediate anti-cancer immunity. For this purpose, four distinct strategies have been exploited, including a decrease in TAM population, switching from M2 polarization into M1 phenotypes, controlling mac- rophage phagocytic signal, and bioengineering of mac- rophages for increasing phagocytosis [79]. Currently, the nanostructures have been widely applied to re-educate TAMs [80], change phagocytosis ability [81], suppress TAMs [82] and deliver drugs to TAMs [83] for cancer immunotherapy.\ncytokines,\nalterations and signaling network changes that acceler- ate tumor development [85]. Under specific conditions, CAFs may exhibit anti-cancer activities, contributing to tumor suppression [86].\nThe heterogeneity of CAFs arises from their diverse origins, including normal fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, peritumoral adipocytes, pericytes, hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and cancer stem cells [87]. Based on their functions, CAFs may be categorized into two groups: carcinogenic and anti-carcinogenic CAFs [88, 89]. Ohlund and colleagues identified two distinct subtypes of CAFs in pancreatic cancer: myofibroblasts (myCAFs) and inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) [90]. The myCAFs, located near cancer cells, are stimulated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- ) and exhibit high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin ( -SMA). In contrast, iCAFs are positioned fur- ther away from cancer cells. They demonstrate elevated  -SMA levels and the ability to secrete IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor [91].\nAnother subclass of CAFs, antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), express biomarkers related to the MHC-II class and CD44, enabling them to stimulate CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner [92]. Additionally, there is a subtype known as restraining CAFs (rCAFs). Each of these subpopulations plays a distinct role in cancer. For example, iCAFs and myCAFs contribute to metabolic reprogramming and angiogenesis in cancer, respectively. The iCAFs can secrete growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, including PD-L1/L2, Fas ligand, and oth- ers, that influence the regulation of the immune system. The myCAFs, on the other hand, contribute to extracel- lular matrix remodeling by enhancing collagen synthesis. The apCAFs are involved in stimulating CD4+ T cells for immune cell regulation, while rCAFs exhibit the ability to suppress tumorigenesis [93]. Regarding the importance of CAFs in tumorigenesis, targeting CAFs for cancer immunotherapy has been of importance. The nanostruc- tures demonstrate high penetration and permeability in tumor sites, and can be utilized to regulate CAFs [94]. Moreover, nanoparticles can be utilized to engineer CAFs to act as APCs and stimulate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in cancer immunotherapy [95]. Nanostructures can trigger clearance of activated and senescent CAFs [96], and regulation of CAFs by nanoparticles can disrupt cancer metastasis and invasion [97].\nNeutrophils\nCancer-associated fibroblasts\nCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent a diverse group of cells that infiltrate the TME. The CAFs are dis- tinct from normal fibroblasts [84]. These cells play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by inducing biochemical\nUp to 70% of circulating leukocytes are comprised of neu- trophils [98], and are considered a first-line against patho- gens [99]. Neutrophils have a short life and can persist in circulation for five days [100]. When there is tissue dam- age or infection, the epithelial cells secrete chemokines to recruit neutrophils. Upon this, neutrophils extravasate\nthe blood circulation, enter damaged tissue to secrete a number of inflammatory cytokines, release neutro- phil extracellular traps (NETs), and finally, phagocytose the pathogens or invading microorganisms [101]. NETs are vehicles for anti-microbial peptides and toxins [102, 103]. In cancer, there are two categories of tumor-associ- ated neutrophils (TANs) similar to the Th1/Th2 pattern, including N1 and N2 with tumor-suppressor and tumor- promoting function, respectively. Tumor type and stage determine the phenotype of neutrophils in TME. During the first stages of tumorigenesis, neutrophils demonstrate an inflammatory phenotype, and as the cancer advances, the neutrophils achieve an immunosuppression pheno- type [104]. Neutrophil-mediated inflammation regula- tion relies on the secretion of ROS and RNS. Moreover, the extracellular matrix can be re-configured by the neutrophils through the secretion of neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinases. The neutrophils display the ability to stimulate angiogenesis through oncostatin- M, increase carcinogenesis through PGE2, and enhance metastasis of cancer through the release of ROS, RNS, NE and MMP-9. Noteworthy, the NETs have consisted of MMPs, cathepsin G, and NE [105, 106]. The function of these proteases is to mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine degradation and re-accumulate in TME for enhancement in tumorigenesis and metastasis [107]. In cancer patients, the plasticity of circulating neutrophils is of importance, known as high-density neutrophils (HDNs) or low-den- sity neutrophils (LDNs), corresponding to N1 and N2 phenotypes, respectively. LDNs that have an immature phenotype, show prevalence in the circulation of many cancers and participate in carcinogenesis and metastasis [100]. In the field of cancer immunotherapy, the stimula- tion of N1 neutrophils can mediate toxic impacts on can- cer cells [108]. Furthermore, the stimulation of Ly6Ehi neutrophils through the STING pathway can enhance sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy, and they can be utilized as predictors of cancer immunotherapy [109]. Therefore, the development of nanoparticles for targeting neutro- phils in cancer immunotherapy is important.\nUpon maturation, NK cells migrate from the bone mar- row to the blood and subsequently reside in peripheral tissues. Because of their capacity to move between lym- phatic and non-lymphatic tissues, NK cells are distrib- uted in numerous organs and tissues [122 124]. Mature NK cells acquire the capability to exert cytotoxic impacts on cancer cells or virus-infected cells [125]. Serving as contributors to the adaptive immune system, NK cells interact with other immune cells through the secretion of cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines [125]. These effects position NK cells as effective effectors in diseases such as cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and chronic inflammation [126 129].\nMoreover, NK cells play a significant role in the innate immune system, providing surveillance in hemato- logical cancers and cancer metastasis [110, 130, 131]. The increased infiltration of NK cells into the TME is positively associated with the prognosis of various can- cer types, including melanoma, renal cell cancer, liver tumors, and breast cancer, among others [132 136].\nThe adaptive immune system is primarily shaped by T cells, providing effective defense against pathogens and cancers. Upon exposure to cytokines and co-stimulatory signals, na ve T cells undergo proliferation, differentiat- ing into effector cells. Na ve CD4+ T cells can differenti- ate into T helper cells, including TH1, TH2, TH17, and TFH cells, to exert immune functions. The differentiation of na ve CD8+ T cells into effective CD8+ T cells enables these cells to combat infections and cancers through the release of IFN- , TNF- , and cytotoxic molecules [137].\nA challenge in cancer arises from T cell exhaustion. This phenomenon is mediated by various mechanisms, with the PD-1 axis being the most prominent. Upon anti- gen exposure, na ve T cells transform into effector T cells, with some undergoing cell death and others participat- ing in tumor elimination. Antigen presentation can lead to the formation of stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells, which convert into TCM, TEM, and TRM. The TRM cells reside in the tissue, ready to respond to secondary stimulation, while TSCM and TCM possess self-renewal capacity, generating TEM and TE upon re-stimulation [138].\nNatural killer cells and T cells\nAs innate lymphocytes, NK cells exhibit a shorter half-life compared to B and T cells, necessitating their replenish- ment from bone marrow progenitors [110]. The NK cells undergo linear differentiation, with highly proliferative immature NK cells differentiating into fully functional and granular effectors [111 113]. Enhancing the fre- quency, infiltration, and function of NK cells contributes to the improved survival of cancer patients [114 117]. This renders NK cells valuable in cancer immunotherapy. These group I innate lymphoid cells can rapidly target cells without prior sensitization [118], and express T-bet and Th1-related cytokines, including IFN-  [119 121].\nSigns of T cell exhaustion include the expression of inhibitory receptors, reduction in T cell function, and decreased proliferation. Exhausted T cells exhibit a unique epigenetic profile that may result in a differen- tial or poor response to immunotherapy. Additionally, exhausted T cells experience metabolic dysregulation, including mitochondrial suppression and glycolysis inhi- bition [139]. The challenge in cancer therapy extends beyond T cell exhaustion, as their death and reduced proliferation can impair immune reactions. Targeting NK and T cells with nanoparticles has strengthened can- cer immunotherapy. The nanoparticles with high uptake\nin NK cells, such as lipid-based nanoparticles, can be utilized to engineer NK cells [140]. Furthermore, nano- structures can be utilized for non-invasive tracking of NK cells, including their migration and biodistribution in tumor regions [141]. The expression levels of CCR4 and CXCR4 on the surface of NK cells can be changed by nanoparticles to improve their interaction with can- cer cells [142]. Noteworthy, the nanoparticles can be designed to stimulate both NK and CD8+ T cells in can- cer immunotherapy [143].\nEndothelial cells and pericytes\nEndothelial cells form the inner lining of blood vessels. The biological functions of endothelial cells are crucial for preserving normal physiological conditions [144]. These cells play important roles in regulating blood clot- ting, vessel size, and immune functions to enhance blood fluidity, oxygen distribution, cell transport, and nutri- ent supply. Endothelial cells continuously secrete anti- coagulant proteins to prevent clotting in vascular beds, maintaining homeostasis and ensuring blood flow and pressure at an appropriate level to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues [145 149].\nDespite their essential physiological functions, endo- thelial cells have been implicated in cancer progression. Recent reviews have highlighted the role of endothelial cells in the tumor stroma [150, 151]. In the initial stages, endothelial cells induce angiogenesis to increase the pres- ence of blood vessels in the primary tumor. These cells also function as a platform and site for membrane-bound factors and proteins, creating a TME conducive to can- cer progression. These localized functions of endothelial cells also play a role in regulating angiocrine signaling at distant sites, influencing organ function. Furthermore, factors and proteins secreted by tumor cells can extend beyond tumor boundaries, affecting endothelial cells at distant sites and exerting systematic functions [152].\nUnderstanding the functions and regulatory impacts of tumors beyond their sites is crucial, given that most cancer-related deaths result from invasion, thrombosis, and cachexia [153 155]. Proteins and factors secreted by tumor cells can induce changes in endothelial cells in the pre-metastatic niche, enhancing the dissemination of cancer cells and mediating angiogenesis. Additionally, these factors can lead to thrombosis in distant vascula- ture [156]. Endothelial pericytes have been recognized more than a century ago as microvasculature-associated mural cells [157]. These perivascularly positioned cells [158 160] are ubiquitously distributed in all vascular- ized tissues [161, 162]. Identification of pericytes requires immunostaining and the use of biomarkers and antigens to differentiate them from vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal cells [157]. Initially consid- ered inert cells contributing to physical vascular stability\n[163, 164], recent advances have illuminated their roles in both physiological and pathological conditions.\nPericytes play a crucial role in regulating blood vessel development and modulating blood flow, coagulation, and vascular permeability [165]. The structure of capil- laries includes endothelial cells, pericytes, the basement membrane, and vascular smooth muscle cells [166]. The primary function of pericyte function in cancer progres- sion is stimulating angiogenesis in the TME [167]. The CD248 is capable of Wnt upregulation and increasing the levels of OPN and SERPINE1 in pericytes to cause angiogenesis and expedite cancer progression [168]. Additionally, pericyte contractility can be induced by the enzyme hexokinase 2 in glycolysis, leading to abnormali- ties in tumor blood vessels [169]. When present in the tumor site, RGS5-TGF -Smad2/3 creates an anti-apop- totic environment that accelerates cancer cell growth [170]. Figure 2 is a schematic representation of TME components.\nMyeloid-derived suppressor cells\nThe Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are another type of cell present in TME. There are a num- ber of arguments that MDSCs are a subtype of neutro- phils [104] due to the presence of overlapping markers among MDSCs and TANs, making it challenging and problematic to distinguish them. There is still contro- versy regarding whether MDSCs represent a separate lineage of cells or are polarized immature neutrophils [171]. Overall, MDSCs are considered a heterogeneous population of cells with myeloid origin [172]. In spite of origination from myeloid progenitor cells, MDSCs and TANs are considered different cell types. Furthermore, MDSCs demonstrate several distinct features from neu- trophils, including downregulation of CD16 and CD621 and upregulation of Arg1, CD66B, and CD11b [173, 174]. Furthermore, the studies have shown other subtypes of MDSCs including monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), which are distinguished by a CD11b hi, LY6C hi, and LY6G lo phenotype, polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN- MDSCs), which display a CD11b hi, LY6C lo, and LY6G hi phenotype, and early stage MDSCs (eMDSCs) which are CD13- and CD14-, and CD33 + in humans [175, 176]. In TME, it is possible to observe both M-MDSCs and PMN-MDSCs, and compared to MDSCs, they demon- strate a suppressive phenotype [177]. The MDSCs sup- press T cells and the innate immune system to create an immunosuppressive phenotype in TME [177]. MDSCs also contribute to the formation of pre-metastatic niches, can elevate stemness and angiogenesis, and promote metastasis through EMT induction and enhancing IL-6 secretion [178, 179]. There are also other factors in TME that can affect MDSCs. The HIF-1 , a marker of hypoxic TME, stimulates the differentiation of MDSCs into\nFig. 2 Cellular components that influence the tumor microenvironment (TME). Interactions within the TME play a crucial role in accelerating cancer progression. Cancer cells activate the PD-L1/PD-1 axis, leading to T cell exhaustion and impairment of T cell function. In addition, cancer cell-secreted exo- somes that carry PD-1 contribute to T cell dysfunction, reducing proliferation and hindering proper function. Natural killer cells counteract tumorigenesis by secreting perforin and granular enzymes. Increased infiltration of Treg cells in the TME secretes TGF- , inducing fibroblast transformation into cancer- associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promoting extracellular matrix deposition, and causing T cell dysfunction. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) induce Treg cell formation in the TME through the secretion of PGE-2, IL-10, and TGF- . Regulatory T cells (Treg), in turn, suppress the function of dendritic cells (DCs) by secreting perforin, leading to DC cell apoptosis. M2-polarized macrophages secrete TGF-  and IL-10, disrupting DC cell function. The interaction between endothelial cells and cancer cells results in angiogenesis, further enhancing cancer progression (created by Biorender.com)\nTAMs with carcinogenic function [180]. The metabo- lism of MDSCs in TME can be changed towards stimula- tion of fatty acid oxidation to enhance levels of Arg1 and NOS2 [181]. For cancer immunotherapy, the regulation of MDSCs can provide new insights, such as the down- regulation of CCRK that disrupts the immunosuppres- sion activity of MDSCs and promotes the potential of immune-checkpoint blockade therapy [182]. The nano- structures are able to reduce the population and function of MDSCs, impair MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and cause MDSC repolarization [183 185].\nCytokines, chemokines and other factors\nThe immune cells present in the TME use the cytokines to send messages to other cells in an endocrine, para- crine or autocrine manner and provide intercellular communication [186]. Cytokines, also known as immu- nomodulatory agents, can be produced in physiological\nand pathological status, and various classes of cells, including adipocytes and tumor cells, can secrete them. The cytokines contribute to the cellular (type 1) and antibody-mediated (type 2) immunity as anti/pro- inflammatory and pro/anti-tumorigenic effectors that also rely on the TME. Cytokines can bind to the recep- tor on the surface of other cells to regulate their action and change the molecular pathways. There are different kinds of cytokines in TME, including chemokines, inter- leukins, adipokines, transforming growth factors (TGFs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), and interferons (IFN) that can act alone or in a synergistic way to affect immune system [187]. Chemo- kines are considered as chemoattractant cytokines for the recruitment of inflammatory cells, including leukocytes (monocytes, neutrophils), along with other kinds of cells, such as endothelial and epithelial cells [188]. Depending on the position of conserved cysteine residues, there are\nvarious classes of cytokines including CX3C, CXC, CC, or C chemokines [189]. Moreover, chemokines are able to interact with the G protein-linked transmembrane recep- tors known as chemokine receptors [190]. A number of chemokines, such as CXCL8 and CCL3, have an inflam- matory function, and they recruit the cells via the inflam- matory signs or/and homeostatic [191]. Interleukins (ILs) possess a low molecular weight and demonstrate pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. The immunocompetent cells, including T cells, granulocytes, monocytes, mac- rophages, adipocytes, and endothelial cells, can secrete ILs [192]. The ILs play a critical role in the development, differentiation, induction, maturation, migration, and adhesion of immune cells [193]. Adipokines (also known as adipocytokines) are cytokines that can be secreted by adipose tissue and consist of adipocytes, pre-adipocytes, macrophages, stromal cells, fibroblasts, and endothe- lial cells [194]. The adipokines are comprised of adipose tissue-specific cytokines (adiponectin, leptin) and other categories, including ILs, TNFs, and chemokines. More- over, inflammation, energy metabolism, and fat dis- tribution can be controlled by adipokines [195]. The adipokines also contribute to obesity-related inflamma- tion to regulate metabolic diseases [196]. Adipocytes are critical regulators of tumorigenesis and metastasis [197]. According to the impact of adipokines on the immune system, there are two kinds, including pro-inflammatory, such as leptin, TNF , interleukin-1  (IL-1 ), interleu- kin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8), potentially linking adiposity and inflammation, and anti-inflammatory, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and adiponectin [197, 198]. A number of adipokines, such as adiponectin, demonstrate anti-carcinogenic function [198], while others, such as leptin, demonstrate carcinogenic function [199]. TGFs are a number of protein hormones that are overexpressed in human cancers and can modulate tumorigenesis and cancer growth. TGF  is a member of the EGF family with the potential to regulate epithelial development and cell proliferation and can modulate carcinogenesis and angiogenesis [200]. M2 macrophages and other kinds of cells, including cancer cells, can secrete TGF-  to modu- late the function of T cells, NK cells, and macrophages present in TME, disrupting anti-cancer immunity and enhancing carcinogenesis [201]. IFN was discovered upon its function to interfere with viral growth [202]. The host cells secret IFNs, and they can regulate the immune system. The fibroblasts and monocytes are able to secrete type I IFNs such as IFN-  and IFN-  during the viral attack. Then, the expression of proteins with the ability to impair RNA and DNA replication is upregulated. The type II IFNs, including IFN-  can be released by CD8+ T and Th1 cells to induce a number of cells, including NK cells, M1 macrophages, and CD8+ T cells for enhancing\nMHC I and II presentation, promoting the anti-cancer immunity [203].\nEnzymes\nThe changes in the expression level of enzymes are a fea- ture of TME, and it can be exploited in a rational way to treat cancer [204]. Enzymes are a kind of protein or RNA that can facilitate chemical reactions [205]. The enzymes for catalyzing reactions are highly selective and under mild conditions, demonstrate the specific substrates to modulate biological and metabolic mechanisms [206]. The enzymes display a number of changes in expres- sion in diseases such as TME [207]. The TME shows several enzyme secretions consisting of MMPs, hyal- uronidase,  -glutamyl transpeptidase, and esterase with higher expression in tumors compared to normal tissues [208, 209]. The proteases contribute to the degradation of proteins or peptide substrates. The oxidoreductases can mediate the catalysis of electron transfer from the reductant to the oxidant. Kinases provide phosphoryla- tion to affect protein activity and phosphatases mediate dephosphorylation. A number of enzymes demonstrate upregulation such as MMP-2 [210]. In bladder tumors, the expression of HAse is enhanced compared to the nor- mal tissues [211].\nExtracellular matrix components\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is comprised of colla- gen, fibronection, laminin, vitronectin, elastin, and other factors including growth factors, cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases that contribute to the support of the epithelial cell structure [212, 213]. Various cells have the ability to secrete ECM components but they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts [214]. During cancer progression, ECM can be considered as an initiation factor. The com- position of ECM can be different based on the type of cancer, such as gastric tumors, in which a lower degree of differentiation improves the abundance of ECM com- ponents, heightens cell metabolism, and increases meta- bolic reprogramming [215]. According to the proteomic analysis, there is no difference between ECM compo- nents in tumor and normal tissues, while their levels demonstrate changes that are manifested by enhance- ment in ECM proteins and reduction in basement mem- brane components modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion [216]. The density of ECM com- ponents increases during tumor progression, and a num- ber of factors, such as E-cadherin/ -catenin, demonstrate reduction, enhancing proliferation and metastasis of can- cer cells [217]. The increase in matrix density can cause a kind of environmental stress to enhance carcinogenesis. The high-strength ECM can stimulate EMT to increase cancer progression and promote the infiltration of M2\npolarized macrophages while it suppresses the function of CD8+ T cells [218, 219].\nHypoxia\nThe presence of hypoxia is another feature of TME result- ing from the high proliferation of tumor cells. The altera- tions in interstitial fluid pressure, decrease in pH, and enhancement in ROS generation can result from hypoxia [220]. In regions with hypoxia, there is high interstitial fluid pressure due to leaky vasculature and abnormal lymphatic drainage in the tumor [221]. Moreover, the hypoxia in TME can enhance the generation of lactic acid and carbonic acid through glycolysis induction, pro- viding an acidic pH. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) can induce carbonic anhydrase IX or XII to transform carbon dioxide and water into HCO3  that, upon diffu- sion out of the cell membrane, it enhances HCO3  lev- els in TME. Furthermore, the endosomal and lysosomal vesicles in tumor cells demonstrate more acidic pH com- pared to cytosolic pH [222]. The hypoxia TME displays a redox potential difference between intracellular space (reducing) and extracellular space (oxidizing). Such redox potential is vital for the development of smart and selec- tive delivery of therapeutics [223]. The enzymatic reduc- tion during hypoxia in TME can cause the metabolism of chemical factors, including nitro, quinones, aromatic N-oxides, aliphatic N-oxides, and transition metals [224]. Such a feature can be utilized to develop hypoxia-respon- sive structures for exploiting the hypoxic regions [225].\nMechanisms of immune evasion in cancer and unanswered questions in cancer immunotherapy The immune system has undergone a transforma- tive evolution to combat cancer progression. However, immune responses can be suppressed, and tumor cells often employ mechanisms to evade these responses, a concept known as immune evasion. Recent studies have shed light on the major mechanisms contributing to the immune evasion of cancer cells.\nMutations within tumor cells can facilitate immune evasion. This is evidenced by the dysregulation of CD8+ T cells observed in clinical specimens harvested from ovarian cancer patients, accompanied by the activation of immunosuppressive signaling through TGF-  [226]. A well-known mechanism for inducing immune evasion is the upregulation of PD-L1. In hepatocellular carcinoma, USP22 expression increases via PRDM1, leading to diminished SPI1 degradation through USP22 upregula- tion. This, in turn, results in increased PD-L1 expression, promoting immune evasion [227].\nEfforts to suppress PD-L1 have shown promise in disrupting immune evasion. RNF31, with its ability to downregulate PD-L1 by enhancing ubiquitination and degradation of YAP, improves the function of CD8+ T\ncells, offering potential in cancer immunotherapy [228]. While immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly improved tumor suppression and immunotherapy poten- tial, the efficacy of these treatments is compromised by mechanisms related to immune evasion.\nIn addition to the previously discussed mechanisms, Choi and colleagues [229] proposed that lactic acid, a byproduct of cancer cell metabolism, plays a crucial role in suppressing anti-cancer immunity. This hypoth- esis has been substantiated by further research, notably in the comprehensive review by Wang and colleagues [230]. Their findings indicate that the accumulation of lactic acid and the resulting acidic tumor microenviron- ment (TME) significantly impair anti-cancer immune responses. Notably, it has been demonstrated that the presence of lactic acid and the acidic conditions within the TME inhibit the function of various immune cells, including T cells and dendritic cells. This leads to an immunosuppressive environment that promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Such insights underscore the complex interplay between cancer cell metabolism and immune evasion, emphasizing the pivotal role of lactic acid and the acidic TME as key contributors to cancer progression.\nUpregulation of inhibitors such as SUSD6, TMEM127, and WWP2 in MHC-I has been implicated in immune evasion. Downregulation of SUSD6 increases MHC-I antigen presentation, suppressing cancer progression in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. The mechanism involves SUSD6 forming a complex with TMEM127 and MHC-I to recruit WWP2 for lysosomal degradation of MHC-I, facilitating immune evasion [231].\nMHC-I, a key factor in immune evasion, undergoes internalization and degradation by CEMIP, further reducing immune surveillance [232]. In addition, SOX4- induced T cell exhaustion mediated immune evasion. The interaction between cancer cells and CD8+ T cells, facilitated by Midkine, alters immune system responses [233]. In PTEN-deficient animal models, PI3K  down- regulation results in STAT3 suppression, accelerating immune responses and revealing the potential of PI3K  in causing immune tolerance and evasion [234].\nChromosomal changes and deletions also play a role in immune evasion. Homozygous deletions affecting chro- mosome 9q21.3 impair the function of CDKN2A/B, has- tening carcinogenesis. Half of these deletions affect the IFN gene cluster on chromosome 9q21.3, increasing the escape of tumor cells from CD8+ T cell surveillance [235]. Maintaining the balance of interferon responses is vital for cancer immunotherapy, as alterations in interferon and T cell levels can induce immune evasion. mTORC1 enhances B7-H3 expression, reducing T cell function and IFN-  responses while increasing MHC-II expression [236]. One mechanism causing immune escape involves\nreducing the number of T cells, mediated by apoptosis induction. Extracellular galectin 4 stimulates T cell apop- tosis, diminishing immune surveillance. Conversely, the downregulation of galectin 4 promotes M1 polarization of macrophages and enhances T cells and dendritic cells, disrupting immune escape [237].\nThe immune cells have shown potential in the identi- fication and recognition of neoplastic cells possessing initiation mutations to suppress tumorigenesis [238]. Although the origination of a tumor is from a single transformed cell, the presence of genomic instability can cause the generation of cancer cells that are genetically heterogeneous with unique morphological and physi- ological characteristics. Moreover, the tumor cells have shown significant features in terms of surface molecule expression, proliferation and angiogenesis [239] resulting from the morphological and epigenetic plasticity. Hence, the cancer cells demonstrate expression of different anti- gens that may be tumor-specific or tumor-associated, differentiation antigens, and lectin-binding sites. Such antigens display uneven distribution on tumor subpop- ulations and can stimulate various immune responses [240]. Such tumor heterogeneity can significantly affect the genotype, gene expression, cellular morphology, metabolic activity, motility, and behaviors, including proliferation, antigen presentation, drug response, and metabolism [241]. Furthermore, this heterogeneity can be utilized for the diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, and recog- nition of promising targets [242]. Such a heterogeneous nature of cancer cells can provide significant opportu- nities to escape from the function of immune cells. The tumor cells significantly proliferate in TME, which can cause hypoxia. The presence of hypoxia in TME recruits MDSCs and impairs the function of NK cells to provide a pre-metastatic niche [243], showing that cancer cells metastasize through suppressing immune surveillance. Upon surgical resection, the cancer cells undergo trauma, and such tumor cells can enhance the generation of cyto- kines and other factors, including IL-6, C-reactive pro- tein (CRP), TNF- , IL-1  to affect the immune system [244]. Therefore, the application of conventional thera- pies and the heterogeneous nature of cancer cells should be considered in immune evasion. The immune cells are able to suppress vulnerable cancer cells presenting tumor antigens [245], while the heterogeneous nature of cancer cells allows them to escape such action of the immune system. Furthermore, the tumor cells have shown capac- ity to induce apoptosis in tumor-specific cytotoxic T lym- phocytes [246].\ndrivers of cancer immunity should be highlighted. More- over, more investigation should be directed towards understanding the function of organ-specific tumor immune context. Checkpoint inhibitors are commonly utilized for the treatment of human cancers, but there is still a long way towards understanding the molecular landscape of factors regulating primary versus secondary immune escape. There is a big question about whether it is better to use endogenous or synthetic immunity for the treatment of human cancers. Moreover, since cancer immunotherapy has been applied in clinics, there are also questions regarding the effective evaluation of cancer immunotherapy in clinical studies. One of the hopes is the advances in the field of biology highlighting the appli- cation of biomarkers and signatures for cancer immuno- therapy. Therefore, precision medicine can significantly benefit by highlighting the signatures and developing strategies based on targeting accurate and efficient sig- natures for cancer immunotherapy. Another question is that various types of regimens for cancer immuno- therapy have been developed, and comprehensive stud- ies are required to be performed in improving long-term survival through a combination of such regimens. In order to optimize the process of cancer immunotherapy, responding to such concerns and questions can improve the potential for the treatment of cancer patients [247].\nNanoparticles targeting tumor microenvironment components in cancer immunotherapy Nanoparticles targeting tumor-associated macrophages\nTo address the immunosuppressive role played by M2-polarized macrophages, the stimulation of M1 polar- ization through nanostructures emerges as a promising avenue for enhancing immunotherapy. A pivotal mecha- nism involves the development of genetically modified pristine cells, whose extracted cell membrane is uti- lized to coat and functionalize nanoparticles in cancer therapy. Biomimetic magnetic nanoparticles featuring gene-edited cell membranes demonstrate the capacity to target multiple pathways, thereby regulating macrophage polarization and suppressing tumorigenesis. Specifically, the presence of gene-edited cell membranes suppresses the CD44/SIRP  axis by upregulating SIRP  variants. Magnetic nanoparticles, forming the core, play a crucial role in re-educating and reprogramming macrophages, thereby accelerating cancer immunotherapy [248].\nTherefore, since immune evasion commonly occurs in cancer, cancer immunotherapy has been introduced. Regarding cancer immunotherapy, there are a number of challenges that should be addressed. The first and most important challenge is regarding the fact that dominant\nChanges in macrophages extend beyond polarization, and their role in regulating antigen processing is also significant. Certain clinically important pathways, such as STING, pose a challenge for targeting at the clini- cal level due to a lack of targeted delivery. By function- ing as a STING agonist, ZnCDA encapsulates CDA and disrupts the endothelial barrier in cancer vasculature, facilitating penetration into the TME and tumor site.\nThese nanoparticles target macrophages, enhancing anti- gen processing and expediting T-cell-related responses in cancer immunotherapy [249]. A number of nanoparticles have shown potential in changing the polarization of TAMs. In the context of M1 polarization of macrophages, different mechanisms are available for the induction of polarization of macrophages into the M1 phenotype. Ginseng-derived nanostructures with extracellular vesi- cle-like properties can stimulate the TLR4/MyD88 axis, resulting in increased M1 polarization of macrophages, elevated ROS levels, and induction of apoptosis in mela- noma [250]. In fact, the M1 polarization of macrophages has been accompanied by apoptosis induction.\nAlthough the primary focus of this section is to evalu- ate the role of nanoparticles in macrophage re-educa- tion, studies have demonstrated that membranes can be extracted from macrophages to coat and functional- ize nanoparticles. This approach results in the develop- ment of biocompatible structures with stealth properties [251]. Such an approach can be used mutually in which nanoparticles are functionalized with macrophage mem- brane to improve their targeting ability towards mac- rophages and TME, and on the other hand, they can be designed for re-education of macrophages into M1 phenotype.\nTargeting macrophages in cancer treatment is pri- marily driven by their immunosuppressive function. Despite the development of various immune response regulation strategies, such as phototherapy-induced immunotherapy, concerns persist regarding immuno- genicity and inflammation induction. Therefore, it is crucial for nanoparticles to employ safe and biocompat- ible mechanisms to counteract macrophage-mediated immunosuppression. The biomimetic Fe3O4-SAS@PLT nanostructures, derived from sulfasalazine-loaded meso- porous magnetic nanostructures and functionalized with platelets, have been designed to suppress the glutamate- cystine antiporter system Xc-pathway in ferroptosis induction. This ferroptosis induction demonstrates syn- ergistic effects with PD-L1 immune checkpoint immu- notherapy, as observed in animal models. Notably, these biomimetic nanostructures induce ferroptosis, promot- ing M1 polarization of macrophages and disrupting the immunosuppressive TME [252].\ninvolves functionalizing them with macrophage mem- branes to enhance efficacy. This hypothesis has been tested in experiments, demonstrating the potential of from tumor-associated macro- membranes derived phages with immunomodulatory functions and anti- gen-homing affinity. These membranes were employed to functionalize upconversion nanostructures loaded with photosensitizers. Notably, tumor-associated mac- rophage membrane-functionalized nanoparticles sup- press CSF1 and interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, impairing tumorigenesis. Moreover, these nanoparticles stimulate photodynamic therapy by suppressing the M2 phenotype, enhancing M1 macrophage polarization, inducing immunogenic cell death, and improving the generation of T cells through enhanced antigen presentation [254].\nReorienting macrophages toward the M2 pheno- type presents a hurdle in achieving successful immu- notherapy. This polarization is chiefly instigated by tumor cell-secreted MCSF, resulting in the elevation of CSF1-R. Moreover, the heightened expression of SIRP  on myeloid cell surfaces activates SHP-1 and SHP-2 in macrophages, impeding immunotherapy by hampering phagocytosis. Moving beyond macrophage polarization, efforts are redirected to address macrophage activity failure. To augment macrophage phagocytosis, promis- ing strategies involve the regulation of CSF1R and SHP2. Nanoparticles laden with CSF1R and SHP2 suppressors induce M1 macrophage polarization, boosting phagocy- tosis to impede tumorigenesis [255].\nAfter elucidating the key mechanisms governing mac- rophage polarization and activity, the subsequent focus involves exploring nanoparticles with potential clinical applications. The FDA-approved ferumoxytol, an iron supplement and iron oxide nanostructure, serves dual roles as a drug delivery system and imaging agent. When co-cultured with macrophages for treating lung cancer metastasis, ferumoxytol upregulates caspase-3, inducing macrophages to express mRNAs for pro-inflammatory Th1-related responses. Ferumoxytol effectively sup- presses tumor metastasis and proliferation while promot- ing M1 macrophage polarization to enhance the quality of cancer immunotherapy [256].\nWhen considering nanoparticles for modulating mac- rophages, especially for potential use in cancer immu- notherapy at the clinical level, biocompatibility is as important as functionality. Lipid nanoparticles with cat- ionic features have shown promise as carriers, delivering mRNA to targeted sites. Loading mRNA for re-educating macrophage polarization onto lipid nanoparticles cre- ates safe and biocompatible nanostructures for cancer immunotherapy [253]. A significant advancement in utilizing nanoparticles for macrophage re-education\nA growing body of evidence supports the poten- tial involvement of tumor-associated macrophages in the development of drug resistance [257, 258]. These macrophages play a role beyond immune system regu- lation, influencing the response to chemotherapy. Furin- based aggregated gold nanostructures capitalize on the  enhanced permeability and retention  effect, aggregating in breast cancer due to furin upregulation. This process suppresses exocytosis, leading to increased preferential accumulation at the tumor site. These nanoparticles also inhibit autophagy, promoting M1 macrophage education\nto counteract drug resistance [259]. Table 1 provides a concise overview of the applications of nanoparticles in macrophage re-education for cancer immunotherapy. Figure 3 provides an overview of the regulation of tumor- associated macrophages by nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy.\nNanoparticles targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts\nNanoparticles play a crucial role in influencing cancer- associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the cancer treatment landscape. Interactions between cancer cells and CAFs in the TME contribute to tumorigenesis, making it essential to explore nanoparticle applications in suppressing these interactions and impeding cancer progression. In ovar- ian cancer, ovarian cancer cells and TME cells promote the activation of ovarian CAFs. Gold nanoparticles with a size of 20 nm effectively disrupted this interaction, inhib- iting CAF activation and offering potential in the treat- ment of ovarian cancer [275].\nCAFs play a supportive role in tumor metastasis. Core-shell nanoparticles, with gold as the core and sil- ver as the shell, were effective in suppressing osteopontin expression in CAFs, hindering cancer progression with- out impacting CAF biomarker expression [276]. Besides modulating CAF activation and secretions, nanostruc- tures may also be used for targeted CAF destruction. Ultra-small iron oxide nanocarriers (6 nm in diameter) combined with low-frequency rotating magnetic fields induce mechanical forces, leading to CAF death and lysosomal disruption [277]. Targeting CAFs for destruc- tion enhances nanoparticle internalization. Such a strat- egy addresses the challenge of a dense TME that hinders nanoparticle penetration. Ferritin nanocages loaded with the photosensitizer ZnF16Pc and modified with a single- chain variable fragment that targeted fibroblast activa- tion protein, facilitated phototherapy to reduce CAFs and improve nanoparticle penetration into the tumor site [278].\nSome nanoparticles are designed to respond to fibro- blast activation protein as a CAF biomarker. Albumin nanostructures encapsulating paclitaxel and functional- ized with CAP showed promise in targeting fibroblast activation protein in CAFs. Incorporation of the photo- sensitive compound IR-780 further enabled near-infra- red laser irradiation for photothermal therapy, resulting in tumor suppression and improved deep tumor pen- etration [281]. The concept of specifically targeting CAFs using their biomarkers has significant potential in enhancing the fight against cancer.\nNanoparticles targeting T cells\nNanoparticles, through targeted regulation of T cells, have emerged as a promising avenue for effective cancer immunotherapy [282 288]. Increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and T helper cells in the TME is crucial for TME remodeling and activating the immune system against cancer progression. Nanoparticles such as man- ganese zinc sulfide nanostructures play a pivotal role in mediating this effect [289]. A noteworthy trend in recent years involves the integration of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities like chemotherapy or pho- totherapy. Hybrid prodrug nanocarriers carrying cispla- tin and camptothecin, stimulate the cGAS/STING axis and induce DNA damage. Additionally, these prodrug nanocarriers enhance CD8+ T cell infiltration in the TME, improving immunotherapy outcomes for colorec- tal cancer. These hybrid nanocarriers possess a respon- sive feature to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are constructed from mPEG2k-DSPE and other polymers [290]. The mPEG/PLGA/PLL nanocarriers, delivering CD155-siRNA and modified with PD-L1 antibodies, can simultaneously suppress CD155 and PD-L1, avoid- ing immune evasion. They enhance CD8+ T cell infiltra- tion and induce immunogenic cell death in breast cancer therapy [291].\nNanoparticles can serve dual functions in regulating CAFs and modulating immune responses. Poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles functionalized with cancer cell membrane not only enhanced cancer cell-CAF interactions, but also increased antigen uptake, stimulating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells through MHC-I and MHC-II, thus promoting cancer immunotherapy [279]. The fibroblast activation protein, upregulated on CAF surfaces, represents a promising target in cancer immu- notherapy. Nanoparticles functionalized with a single- chain variable fragment for ZnF16Pc delivery in cancer phototherapy lacked systemic toxicity. These function- alized nanoparticles suppressed cancer progression in both primary and distant sites by accelerating immune responses and promoting anti-CAF immunity [280].\nDeveloping an effective anti-cancer vaccine requires nanoparticles that can immunity. MnO2-melittin nanostructures, responsive to changes in the TME, serve as promising vaccines by trigger- ing systemic immune responses. These nanostructures induce cancer cell death through the Fenton reaction in the TME, activate the cGAS/STING axis, and enhance antigen-presenting cell maturation. Furthermore, MnO2- melittin nanoparticles stimulate systemic immune reac- tions, including the promotion of T cells and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [292].\ninduce systemic\nis Combining chemotherapy with phototherapy another strategy to expedite tumor suppression. Pro- drug nanocarriers, developed from hyaluronic acid and adamantine-conjugated heterodimers of PPa and JQ1, target CD44-overexpressed pancreatic cancer cells.\nr e f e R\ne c n e\n] 0 6 2 [\n] 1 6 2 [\n] 2 6 2 [\n] 3 6 2 [\n] 4 6 2 [\n] 5 6 2 [\n] 6 6 2 [\n] 7 6 2 [\n] 8 6 2 [\n] 9 6 2 [\n] 0 7 2 [\n] 1 7 2 [\ns e g a h p o r c a m g n i t e g r a t h g u o r h t y p a r e h t o n u m m\nr e c n a c d e c u d n i -

The use of cancer vaccines has significantly increased in recent years; however, a major challenge remains in the targeted delivery of cargo, including anti- gens and adjuvants. To address this issue, glycosylated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocarriers have been developed for the delivery of the ovalbumin antigen and CpG as an adjuvant in cancer vaccination. The sur- face of the nanostructures is modified with galactose or mannose. These nanoparticles possess high loading abil- ity and sustained release, which are key features for the development of cancer vaccines. They stimulate dendritic cell maturation, promote antigen uptake, and enhance CD4+ T cell levels, leading to increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells in cancer immunotherapy [294].\nAn innovative approach in cancer therapy involves developing nanoparticles that mimic pathogens to induce a robust immune response. Saccharomyces cerevisiae function as nano-patho- (yeast)-based nanocarriers gen-associated molecular patterns (nano-PAMPs) and, through the induction of Dectin-2 and TLR-4, enhance TH17 responses, contributing to anti-cancer immunity [295]. Stimulation of T helper cells has proven effective in cancer immunotherapy. Chondroitin sulfate-modified nanostructures conjugated with glycolic acid or man- nose, along with cationic liposomes loaded with ovalbu- min, can stimulate the maturation of dendritic cells and evoke T helper type I and II responses [296]. In many cases, nanoparticles not only stimulate T cell infiltra- tion, but also accelerate the maturation of dendritic cells, contributing to cancer immunotherapy [297]. Recogniz- ing the role of epigenetic changes in immune dysfunc- tion, the delivery of miRNAs has been explored in cancer immunotherapy. Lipid nanoparticles delivering anti- miR-21 have demonstrated the ability to stimulate M1 polarization of macrophages and enhance the infiltration of CD8+ T cells [298].\n) d e u n i t n o c (\n1 e l b a T\nl l\ne C / e p y t\nr e c n a C\ne l c i t r a p o n a N\ne n\ni l\n0 1 F 6 1 B / a m o n a e M\nl\nl y d i t a h p s o h P\ns l l\ne c\nd e fi d o m - e n i r e s\ni\ns e c i t r a p o n a n\nl\nl l\ne c\nl l\na m\ns - n o N\nd c a c n o r u a y H l\ni\ni\nr e c n a c g n u\nl\nd e z i l\na n o i t c n u\nf\ns e c i t r a p o n a n\nl\n1 T 4 / r e c n a c t s a e r B\no t i h c y h t e m\ni r T\ns l l\ne c\ns e c i t r a p o n a n n a s\nl\nNanoparticles have been employed for targeted regu- lation of immunosuppressive Treg cells in cancer treat- ment, aiming to enhance immunotherapy potential. For example, PLGA nanoparticles with antigen-capturing capabilities have been developed for this purpose. These nanoparticles primarily elevate the CD8+ T cell count, consequently increasing the ratio of cytotoxic T cells to Treg cells [299]. By augmenting this ratio, the negative impact of Treg cells on immune responses can be allevi- ated. For enhanced cargo delivery, layer-by-layer nano- structures, composed of GITR/PLGA and modified with\nFig. 3 The impact of nanoparticles on macrophages, showcasing their potential to re-educate and impede cancer progression. These nanoparticles effectively target key mechanisms associated with the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. They inhibit CD44/SIRP , CS1R, and MAPK, prompting the M1 polarization of macrophages. Additionally, nanocarriers activate the TLR4/MyD88 axis, contributing to increased M1 polarization of the tumor-associated macrophages. The nanoparticles further induce ferroptosis and photodynamic therapy, disrupting the polarization of these macro- phages into the M2 phenotype (Created by Biorender.com)\nPLG and PLH that are responsive to the TME pH, have been designed to deliver IR780 dye. Subsequent irradia- tion with a 808 nm laser promotes the maturation of den- dritic cells, thereby increasing the activity of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in cancer immunotherapy. Notably, these nanoparticles exhibit a suppressive effect on Treg cell function, contributing positively to immune reactions [300].\nSeveral widely used chemotherapeutic drugs, includ- ing doxorubicin, face limitations such as low tumor site accumulation and the development of drug resistance. Prodrug nanocarriers based on doxorubicin and indoxi- mod have been developed to suppress the IDO pathway. These prodrug nanocarriers induce immunogenic cell death, enhance the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells), and suppress Treg cells, MDSCs, and TAMs in the TME, thereby effectively promoting T cell/Treg cell ratio for cancer immunotherapy [301].\nCo-delivery strategies have been used to improve can- cer immunotherapy. Metformin, a compound utilized for\ncancer immunotherapy, has shown promise in re-educat- ing the TME and enhancing macrophage phagocytosis activity. Co-assembled prodrug nanoparticles, designed with hyaluronic acid-cisplatin/polystyrene-polymetfor- min, effectively co-deliver metformin and cisplatin. With a size of 166.5 nm and a zeta potential of -17.4 mV, these nanoparticles exhibit high potential in cancer immuno- therapy. They induce apoptosis through PARP upregula- tion, enhance cisplatin sensitivity by suppressing ERCC1, and modulate AMPK /mTOR pathways to increase CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and reduce Treg cell numbers [302].\nUnmodified nanoparticles exhibit poor specific target- ing of Treg cells. This prompted the use of nanocarrier functionalization. Hybrid nanocarriers functionalized with tLyp1 peptide have been developed to suppress STAT3 and STAT5, reducing Treg cell numbers and increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the TME [303]. The functionalized nanoparticles contribute to tumor suppression by increasing the infiltration of\ndendritic cells, CD8+ T, and natural killer cells, while reducing Treg and MDSC cells [304]. Furthermore, poly- merosomes have been shown to stimulate the STING axis and enhance the infiltration and proliferation of T cells in cancer immunotherapy [57]. Table 2 summarizes the application of nanoparticles for the regulation of T cells in cancer therapy. Figure 4 demonstrates the role of nanoparticles in the regulation of CAFs, T cells, and Treg cells.\nNanoparticles regulating hypoxia\nIn each tumor, the levels of oxygen are different [318]. The oxygen insufficiency in tumor tissue generally ranges from more or less anoxic state (almost no oxygen) to 60 mm Hg (8% oxygen). In spite of this, the tumor cells demonstrate a specific condition known as hypoxia in which oxygen levels fluctuate from anoxia to 7.5 mm Hg (about 1% oxygen) [319]. Hypoxia can be considered a reliable biomarker, since it promotes the progression of tumor cells and can cause therapy resistance [320]. Along with tumorigenesis, the hypoxia in cancer enhances, and it shows some coordination with angiogenesis, prolifera- tion, and metastasis. Hypoxia is able to enhance the lev- els of CCL22, CCL28 and increases the accumulation of MDSCs and Tregs to mediate immunosuppressive TME [321 323]. Furthermore, hypoxia has been shown to be a factor involved in immune resistance [324]. Metformin is able to improve cancer immunotherapy by impairing the function of hypoxia in impairing CD8+ T cells [325]. Exercise has been shown as a mechanism for apoptosis induction and decreasing the proliferation of cancer cells. Moreover, exercise can ameliorate hypoxia, and enhance the function of T cells and reduces levels of Treg cells in cancer immunotherapy [326]. Hypoxia has been also shown as a mechanism in increasing M2 polarization of macrophages and secretion of factors with immunosup- pressive function, including VEGF and TGF- . Moreover, hypoxia has been suggested to cause therapy resistance, especially during photodynamic therapy and radiation in which oxygen molecules are required for cancer suppres- sion [180, 327, 328].\nTherefore, the function of hypoxia in cancer immuno- therapy is of importance [329]. Hypoxia can be exploited by the nanoparticles for improving their specificity and recently, the hypoxia-responsive nanostructures have been designed for cancer immunotherapy [330 332]. However, most of the attention has been paid to the regulation of hypoxia in cancer immunotherapy. The biodegradable NIR-II pseudo conjugate polymeric nano- structures can regulate hypoxia in cancer immunother- apy. These nanostructures can deliver regorafenib and respond to 808 nm laser irradiation to release drugs for the reduction of cancer hypoxia through vascular nor- malization, allowing for oxygen entrance into tumors\nto increase ROS generation, mediating immunogenic cell death (ICD) for cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, these nanoparticles reprogram macrophages from M2 to M1 [269]. In another effort, albumin-based nanostruc- tures have been developed for the co-delivery of IR780, NLG919, and hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) in synergistic tumor suppression. Exposure to nanoparticles to NIR irradiation mediates the generation of 1O2 to trigger the release of ROS-responsive linker for TPZ release, causing chemotherapy through enhancing tumor hypoxia. Moreover, these nanostructures stimu- late ICD to enhance the activity of cytotoxicity of T lym- phocytes [333]. Doping the nanoparticles with Mn2+ can alleviate hypoxia and increase cGAS sensitivity, inducing the cGAS/STING pathway, causing macrophage re-edu- cation, and increasing the maturation of dendritic cells [334]. In a number of cases, the hypoxia is boosted in the TME to promote the release of drugs from nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy [335]. Furthermore, mac- rophage-mimetic microalgae and liposomes have been conjugated to suppress autophagy and reduce hypoxia in cancer immunotherapy [336]. Regarding autophagy regu- lation, it should be highlighted that autophagy has a dual function in cancer and can exert carcinogenic and anti- carcinogenic functions, complicating its regulation in cancer therapy [337, 338]. According to these studies, the regulation of hypoxia by nanoparticles can pave the new gate for cancer immunotherapy [339 342].\nNanoparticles targeting myeloid-derived suppressor cells\nThe infiltration of MDSCs is against anti-cancer immu- nity since it impairs T-cell proliferation and enhances the differentiation of Treg cells [343]. MDSCs are consid- eredimmature myeloid cells with a heterogeneous nature providing, an immunosuppressive TME [172]. Over- all, MDSCs utilize three distinct mechanisms to cause immunosuppression. In the first method, the arginase 1 and iNOS undergo upregulation in MDSCs, and they can deplete L-arginine which is vital for the proliferation of T cells and CD3  -chain formation of TCR. However, enhancement in arginase 1 activity and iNOS can sup- press the proliferation and function of T cells [344 347]. In the second method, the MDSCs can enhance the gen- eration of ROS and RNS to mediate dysfunction in T cells [348 350]. The ROS and peroxynitrite derived from MDSCs can cause post-transcriptional alterations in TCR and CD8 to interfere with the function of periph- eral CD8+ T cells and cause antigen-specific tolerance in these cells through impairing binding affinity to phos- phorylated MHC molecules [348]. In the third and final way, MDSCs are able to enhance Treg cell differentiation to disrupt anti-cancer immunity [172, 351]. Upon that, Treg cells secrete a number of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-  to interfere with the proper\nr e f e R\ne c n e\n] 5 0 3 [\n] 6 0 3 [\n] 7 0 3 [\n] 8 0 3 [\n] 9 0 3 [\n] 0 1 3 [\n] 1 1 3 [\n] 2 1 3 [\n] 3 1 3 [\n] 4 1 3 [\n] 5 1 3 [\n] 6 1 3 [\ny p a r e h t\nr e c n a c n\ni\nn o i t a u g e r\nl\ns t h g\ni l\nh g H\ni\nl a i t n e t o p a t e Z / )\nm n ( e z i S\n) V m\n(\nA N R i s -

Therefore, tar- geting MDSCs is critically vital for anti-cancer immunity. The intravenous administration of DNA thioaptamer- functionalized liposomes can cause specific targeting of TME, particularly MDSCs. Moreover, such liposomes provided targeted delivery of doxorubicin in breast can- cer animal models to enhance infiltration of CD8+ T cells and diminish MDSCs [354]. Notably, there are different kinds of immune response-related molecules in TME, including IL-1  [355, 356], IL-6 [357], prostaglandin E2 [358], VEGF [359], and IFN-  [351] that disrupt the dif- ferentiation procedure to increase the accumulation of immature myeloid cells [360]. As a result, one of the promising strategies can be targeting MDSCs for mediat- ing their differentiation into other kinds of immune cells. In line with this, the lipid-coated biodegradable hollow mesoporous silica nanostructures have been introduced to regulate MDSC differentiation. Such nanostructures are able to co-deliver IL-2 and all-trans retinoic acid to trigger the MDSC differentiation into mature dendritic cells, macrophages and granulocytes. These nanoparti- cles showed significant capacity in enhancing the number of mature dendritic cells and decreasing MDSCs. Fur- thermore, these nanoparticles stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased the secretion of IL-12 and TNF-  as anti-tumor cytokines [361].\nNanoparticles for delivery of cargo into antigen-presenting cells and lymph nodes\nOne of the prominent problems in cancer eradication using immunotherapy is the lack of effective and proper delivery into APCs and lymph nodes. The nanoparticles have opened a new gate for the delivery of immuno- therapeutics into APCs and lymph nodes [362]. Note- worthy, a number of nanostructures based on their design, demonstrate the immunostimulatory impact, and even in lack of delivery of cargo, they can stimulate T and B cell responses [363, 364]. The tumor antigens have been conjugated into nanostructures, and upon injection into OVA-expressing melanoma, thymoma, or lymphoma-bearing mice, they caused significant anti- cancer immunity [365, 366]. Furthermore, such model antigens conjugated into nanostructures triggered T cell and antibody responses against lymphoma or colon tumors to impair cancer growth and enhance the sur- vival of animal models [366 368]. The particle size has been considered an important factor in this case, as small virus-size particles (  40 nm) can reach the lymph nodes and demonstrate high cellular uptake by dendritic cells. Then, the peptide presentation from coated antigen by dendritic cell-related MHC class I molecules occurs and the stimulation of CD8+ T cells is observed [369, 370]. The endocytosis of such nanostructures by dendritic cells can stimulate the danger-sensing pathway in dendritic\nFig. 4 Nanoparticles orchestrating immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Nanoparticles elevate antigen presentation via MHC-I and MHC-II, stimulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, thereby facilitating cancer immunotherapy. The nanostructures amplify Dectin-2 and TLR-4 levels, fostering TH17 responses for effective cancer immunotherapy. Additionally, they boost dendritic cell maturation and, through the delivery of anti-miR-21, induce polarization of macrophages into the M1 phenotype. The nanoparticles  downregulation of osteopontin in CAFs disrupts cancer progression. Moreover, these nanoparticles suppress Treg cells, preventing immunosuppression (Created by Biorender.com)\ncells and mature them for immunogenic APCs [371]. The tumor antigen should reach the tumor-draining lymph nodes to be absorbed by professional APC cells such as dendritic cells, and then, their presentation to T cells occurs. The tumor-specific T cells have been found in lymph nodes. However, the dendritic cells in tumor- draining lymph nodes demonstrate an immature/inactive form that compromises their ability to induce anti-tumor T cell responses [372 379]. The nanoparticle-bound cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligonucleotides (an adjuvant) have been shown to accumulate in tumor- draining lymph nodes in melanoma to induce dendritic cells [380].\nNanoparticles targeting tumor cells\nA high number of nanostructure-based methods need tumor infiltration by nanoparticles [381]. The clinical implication of EPR [382, 383] is still under question and a controversial debate, and there is a discussion in which only a small proportion of administered nanostructures\ncan reach the tumor tissues, lacking clinical importance and therapeutic value in the clinical setting [384]. There- fore, significant efforts have been made to improve the ability of nanoparticles to reach tumor tissues and opti- mize the nanostructures in a way to control biologi- cal interactions due to the complicated nature of TME resulting from irregular vascular distribution, high tumor interstitial fluid pressure, low blood flow, dense EZN and high number of stroma cells. Therefore, the strate- gies should be directed towards enhancing the entry of nanostructures into tumor tissue that can be obtained through improving tumor perfusion, elevating tumor vasculature permeability, and mediating ECM remodel- ing. As an example, the nanostructures applied for ECM degradation or restoring tumor vasculature into normal condition [385] can mediate TME priming to provide desirable immune reactions, reversing immunosuppres- sive TME and enhancing anti-cancer immunity [386]. In cases where tumors are accessible, the intratumoral administration of nanoparticles is preferred into systemic\ninjection to enhance accumulation at the tumor region. The proper accumulation of nanoparticles in TME and the release of therapeutic cargo can enhance tumor sup- pression, while it reduces the adverse impacts. A number of clinical studies have suggested the intratumoral injec- tion of immunotherapeutic compounds [387, 388] which has also been confirmed in pre-clinical studies upon intratumoral injection of immune checkpoint inhibitors [389]. The nanoparticles optimized to bind into ECM or cancer cells can enhance the accumulation of these struc- tures in the tumor region [390] and provide a new insight into the effective delivery of therapeutics into tumor cells or TME.\nimprove the potential PD-L1 blockade in cancer immu- notherapy [404]. For stimulation of ICD, various kinds of nanoparticles including polymeric nanostructures [405, 406], liposome-modified polysopamine structures [407], cRGD-functionalized TPGS nanoparticles [408], iron (II)-cytosine-phosphate-guanine nanoparticles [297] and iron oxide nanostructures [409] have been introduced to enhance cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, nanoparti- cle-mediated ICD can cause stimulation of dendritic cells to activate T cells in lymph nodes for increasing cancer immunotherapy.\nCell membrane-coated biomimetic nanostructures Cancer cell membrane-functionalized nanoparticles\nNanoparticles in immunogenic cell death: a rational way in cancer immunotherapy In recent years, ICD has been considered a promis- ing strategy in cancer therapy [391]. The stressed and dying cells release damage-associated molecular pat- terns (DAMPs) to mediate innate anti-cancer immune response and increase T lymphocyte-induced tumor immunity [392]. The ICD is capable of mediating T cell- induced anti-cancer immune responses against tumor antigens [393]. In recent years, the stimulation of ICD by nanoparticles has been suggested as a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy. The PLGA nanostructures have been loaded with potassium chloride nanoparticles and then, functionalized with the cancer cell membrane to release K+ and CI  ions upon lysosomal degradation. Then, these ions cause cancer cell death by mediating a hypertonic state in which cells secrete adenosine triphos- phate (ATP) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) for stimulation of ICD [394]. The  -D-Glucose-reduced silver nanostructures can release calreticulin and increase the release of HSP70, HSP90, HMGGB1, and ATP [395]. These factors are prerequisites for the induction of ICD. In a novel strategy, the chitosan-coated PLGA nanopar- ticles have been loaded with HPV16 E744   62 peptides and then, their functionalization with ICD tumor cell mem- brane has been performed to enhance the maturation of dendritic cells for cancer immunotherapy [396]. Fur- thermore, the Fe3O4 nanostructures have been modified with living bacteria and cancer cell membranes to cause ferroptosis and ICD for enhancing anti-cancer immune responses [397]. Therefore, the increasing evidence high- light the application of nanostructures for the stimula- tion of ICD in cancer immunotherapy [304, 398 403]. In an effort, albumin nanostructures have been devel- oped in which IR780, as photosensitizer was loaded in core and cGAS-STING agonists/H2S producer-ZnS was loaded in shell to mediate photodynamic and photother- mal therapy. These nanostructures mediated pyroptosis through the caspase-3/GSDME axis in mediating den- dritic cell maturation. Then, T cells are activated and\nBiomimetic nanoparticles are characterized by struc- tures whose surfaces are modified or coated with mem- branes from other cells. The development of biomimetic nanoparticles aims to enhance stealth properties, pre- venting their identification by the reticuloendothelial system. Biomimetic nanoparticles exhibit good biocom- patibility, making them widely applicable in cancer treat- ment. Recent studies have explored the potential of biomimetic nanoparticles in cancer therapy, demonstrat- ing their versatility when modified with aptamers [410], facilitating chemotherapy through co-delivery of chemo- therapy drugs and natural products [411], and showcas- ing high penetration and targeting features [412]. They have also been utilized for bioimaging and immunother- apy [413, 414], evading the mononuclear phagocyte sys- tem [415] and improving blood circulation time [416].\nThe application of biomimetic nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy has shown promising results in tumor suppression. In some cases, chemotherapy using bio- mimetic nanoparticles can activate the immune system. For instance, cancer cell membrane-functionalized phos- phorus dendrimer-copper(II) complexes (1G3-Cu) and toyocamycin (Toy)-loaded polymeric nanocarriers with a size of 210 nm can be cleaved in the TME to release cargo and reduce glutathione levels. By causing mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, these nanocarriers trigger apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. They accelerate the maturation of dendritic cells and increase T lymphocyte infiltration. With the applica- tion of PD-L1 antibodies, the nanoparticles can enhance chemotherapy, impair relapse, and prevent the invasion of cancer [417].\nBiomimetic nanoparticles also serve as effective car- riers for delivering siRNA. Recognizing PD-L1 as an immune evasion factor, its downregulation by siRNA can expedite cancer immunotherapy and prevent T cell exhaustion [418]. These nanoparticles exhibit the capa- bility to effectively suppress cancer progression in vivo, making them promising candidates for the development of cancer vaccines [419].\nThe field of cancer therapy has undergone a revolu- tionary transformation with the application of nanogels as drug carriers [420, 421]. Nanogels exhibit favorable physicochemical features. They are potential carriers for delivering both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs [422], recombinant proteins [423], and genetic materials [424].\nNanogel-induced immunotherapy has proven effec- impeding cancer progression. Polymeric tive nanogels, developed from PDEA-co-HP- -cyclodextrin- co-Pluronic F127 and a charge-reversible polymer named dimethylmaleic anhydride-modified polyethyleneimine, undergo degradation in the TME. These nanogels, func- tionalized with cancer cell membranes, co-deliver pacli- taxel and IL-2, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and enhancing the infiltration of effector cells [425].\nin\nStimuli-responsive biomimetic nanocarriers have been engineered to optimize cancer immunotherapy. Polydopamine-CaCO3 nanocarriers, functionalized with cancer cell membranes and featuring pH-responsive characteristics, enable phototherapy and bioimaging. Exposure to the TME triggers the degradation of nano- carriers, releasing CO2 bubbles that promote photo- therapy-mediated immunotherapy. Combining this with checkpoint inhibitors further enhances tumor immuno- therapy [426].\nIn the realm of biomimetic nanovaccines, studies have primarily focused on delivering therapeutics or stimu- lators to dendritic cells. However, the presence of the endocytosis system and endosomal degradation can hin- der the effectiveness of these nanovaccines. To address this issue, biomimetic nanoplatforms have been devel- oped to accelerate the internalization of nanoparticles in dendritic cells. Utilizing ROS-responsive nanoparticu- late cores fused with peptides and cell membranes, these nanovaccines induce micropinocytosis, facilitating direct cytosolic delivery of Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) agonists. This enhances dendritic cell matura- tion and T cell priming through STING upregulation in cancer immunotherapy [427].\nblood cells may also be utilized for the development of biomimetic nanocarriers [429, 430].\nOne of the main reasons for the modification of nanoparticles with the cancer cell membrane is to pro- vide an antigen resource [431, 432]. The PLGA structures have been functionalized with the membrane of mela- noma cells and then, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant was embedded into nanoparticles to stimu- late the maturation of dendritic cells for enhancing anti- gen-specific T cell response [433]. Since the expression of MHC-I can be found in all cells, such as tumor cells, the cancer cell membrane-functionalized nanostructures can be considered novel APC to induce T cells, even in the absence of professional APCs. The CD80-expressing cancer cells were utilized to derive cell membranes for coating nanoparticles. These nanostructures can directly induce antigen-specific T cells through the interac- tion of CD28 with cognate T cell receptors, suppressing tumorigenesis in prophylactic and therapeutic tumor models [288]. Furthermore, the cancer cell-membrane functionalized nanoparticles could be considered as vac- cines. Despite significant efforts to highlight the potential of cancer cell membrane-functionalized nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy, there are several limitations to be considered for future studies. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of ferroptosis in cancer immu- notherapy [434 436]. More effort regarding the applica- tion of biomimetic nanoplatforms in the regulation of ferroptosis and related pathways should be performed to facilitate cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, autophagy is another factor in the regulation of cancer immunother- apy [437 440]. The biomimetic nanoparticles should be designed in a rational way to modulate autophagy for the regulation of T cells and other components of immune systems as well as reprogramming macrophages for effec- tive cancer immunotherapy.\nRed blood cell-functionalized nanoparticles\nThe stimulation of immunogenic cell death and the promotion of dendritic cell maturation and T cell infil- tration represents the primary strategy utilized by biomi- metic nanocarriers in cancer immunotherapy. Regulation of metabolites is crucial for achieving better immuno- therapy responses and immunogenic cell death. Zinc ions-bonded ZIF-8 frameworks with CuS nanodots, functionalized with cancer cell membranes, have been introduced to amplify photothermal-mediated immu- notherapy through Zn2+ metabolic modulation. These frameworks induce immunogenic cell death, enhance dendritic cell maturation, and increase T cell infiltration [428]. Although less explored compared to macrophage- and cancer-derived membranes, the membranes of red\nRed blood cells (RBCs) have obtained much attention for the purpose of drug delivery due to a number of char- acteristics, including biocompatibility, biodegradabil- ity, long lifespan, and desirable encapsulation capacity [441]. The OVA-encapsulated RBCs are able to stimu- late CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after intravenous injection in mice [442]. There is also a promising approach in which RBC membrane is utilized to coat the nanostructures for the development of vaccines with long circulation abil- ity [443]. In an attempt, RBC membrane-functionalized PLGA nanoparticles were designed to deliver both anti- gen hgp10025   33 and adjuvant MPLA. In order to selec- tively target the dendritic cells, mannose was included in the RBC membrane, and these structures demonstrated high potential in suppression of melanoma [444]. How- ever, the studies are limited, and more experiments\nregarding the application of other kinds of nanostruc- tures, such as metal and carbon nanomaterials, and their modification with RBC membrane should be performed to improve the potential in cancer therapy.\nPlatelet-functionalized nanoparticles\nPlatelets are released by megakaryocytes, and they can control homeostasis, tumor invasion, and overall physi- ological and pathological events. Since the platelets have shown expression of self-recognized proteins, includ- ing CD47, they are beneficial for reducing clearance and stimulation of the complement system to enhance the blood circulation time of nanostructures [445, 446]. The platelet membrane-functionalized nanoparticles have been exploited to deliver R848 as a TLR7/8 agonist in enhancing accumulation at the tumor region and pro- moting the interaction with TME components. More- over, even at low doses (18  g vaccine per mouse), they could suppress tumors in 87.5% of mice [447]. More- over, there is the possibility of embedding metformin and IR780 as photosensitizers in platelet membranes to stimulate ICD and improve the potential in cancer immunotherapy through suppressing MDSCs and Treg cells [448]. However, the potential of these nanocarriers in the regulation of TAMs and CAFs for cancer immuno- therapy should be highlighted.\nMacrophage membrane-functionalized nanoparticles\nThe advantage of pH-sensitive biomimetic nanoparticles lies in their ability to induce cancer immunotherapy in a more specific manner due to targeted decomposition in the TME. Immunotherapy with the use of biomimetic nanocarriers may be enhanced through phototherapy. Photo-responsive nanocarriers, the accel- eration of ROS generation, mediate immunotherapy. Macrophage membrane-based vesicles, functioning as nanoparticles, deliver drugs and photosensitizers (TAPP) to induce pyroptosis. These biomimetic vesicles, releasing copper ions, mediate ROS-induced pyropto- sis. Utilized as nanoparticles, they increase ROS levels, inducing pyroptosis through the upregulation of caspase- 3-induced gasdermin E, resulting in pyroptosis-induced immunotherapy [449].\nthrough\nThe macrophage membrane-functionalized nano- structures have shown high potential in specific tumor targeting [450]. The macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles have been utilized for the delivery of saikopsaponin D, and the surface has been hybridized by adding T7 peptide to provide macrophage-homing capacity for nanostructures and target the tumor cells upregulating transferrin receptor. These nanoparticles specifically accumulate at the tumor site and can escape phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system [451]. The functionalization of MOF-derived mesoporous carbon\nnanostructures with macrophage membranes has been performed to increase their escape from phagocytosis and improve the potential in cancer therapy [452]. In addition to high specificity in tumor targeting, the mac- rophage membrane-functionalized nanoparticles dem- onstrate high biocompatibility that, along with their anti-cancer activity, are promising candidates for tumor eradication [251, 453]. Therefore, increasing evidences highlight the application of macrophage membrane-func- tionalized nanoparticles in cancer therapy [454 459]. In order to better highlight their potential, it is suggested to develop biomimetic nanoparticles functionalized with cancer and macrophage membranes to improve potential in cancer immunotherapy.\nThe biomimetic nanoplatforms are also interesting for the regulation of specific mechanisms such as hypoxia and lipid metabolism in TME. Biomimetic nanoparticles may be designed to present tumor antigens and co-stimu- latory molecules simultaneously for cancer immunother- apy [460]. The most effective strategy thus far is centered around the development of biomimetic nanoparticles with pathogen-like features. These biomimetic nanopar- ticles can elicit significant and long-term immune responses in cancer therapy. One of the key reasons for the application of biomimetic nanoparticles is their abil- ity to enhance the blood circulation time of cargo. Cho- lesterol reduction in the membrane used for nanoparticle functionalization improves blood circulation time and its effectiveness in inducing cancer immunotherapy [461]. Because of rapid cancer cell proliferation, the hypoxic and nutrient-deficient conditions within the TME hin- der the proper functioning of immune cells. The devel- opment of a biomimetic platform to increase glucose and glutamine levels required by T cells can reprogram the TME, and accelerate cancer immunotherapy [462]. Table 3; Fig. 5 summarize the application of biomimetic nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy.\nExosomes as emerging nanostructures for cancer immunotherapy Exosomes, ranging in diameter from 30 to 150 nm, are extracellular vesicles secreted by eukaryotic cells [470]. They play a crucial role in intercellular communication by carrying lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. After their secretion into the extracellular matrix, exosomes can be found in various biological fluids such as amniotic fluid, saliva, urine, and breast milk, among others [471, 472].\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the application of exosomes in the field of cancer therapy, with a heightened focus on the diverse cargo they can transport.

These modifica- tions improve the potential of nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy. Biomimetic nanoparticles may be utilized for drug and gene delivery by improv- ing stealth properties. They demonstrate prolonged blood circulation and can induce maturation of dendritic cells, increase infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and cause immunogenic cell death. (Created by Biorender.com)\nexosomes in cancer treatment. The following subsections delve into the exploration of the potential of endogenous exosomes that are naturally secreted by cells in the body, as well as bioengineered exosomes created in the labora- tory for the treatment of cancer.\nof cancer. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME secrete exosomes, transferring miR-93-5p to suppress the STAT3 axis. Enrichment of miR-93-5p in these exosomes, induced by IL-6, leads to MDSC dif- ferentiation into M2 macrophages, facilitating colitis- induced cancer development [474].\nEndogenous exosomes\nThe primary source of exosome secretion includes nor- mal cells, stromal cells, cancer cells, and immune cells. Exosomes secreted by breast cancer cells, for example, play a role in inducing immunotherapy by reprogram- ming macrophage polarization. These exosomes carry PEDF, promoting M1 macrophage polarization by increasing CD80, IRF5, MCP1, and IL-1  levels, while reducing CD206, Arg, TGM2, and TGF-  levels [473].\nDespite the immunotherapeutic potential of exosomes, there are endogenously-secreted exosomes that enhance M2 macrophages, thereby contributing to cancer pro- gression. Inflammation, a risk factor for cancer, can initi- ate cancer development, and the regulatory functions of macrophages in inflammation can alter the pathogenesis\nWhen macrophages polarize into the M2 phenotype, they release exosomes enriched with apolipoprotein E that reduces MHC-I expression, resulting in decreased immunogenicity and induced immune resistance [475]. Detecting exosomes with immunosuppressive/inductive functions involves recognizing their surface biomark- ers. Exosomes positive for PD-L1 are implicated in sup- pressing immune reactions during cancer progression. PD-L1 + exosomes stimulate CD8+ T cell exhaustion, enhancing tumorigenesis during cancer metastasis [476]. The secretion of PD-L1 + exosomes involves intricate molecular pathways, where HMGB1 upregulates RIC- TOR mRNA levels through miR-200 family downregu- lation, particularly miR-429. This HMGB1 and RICTOR crosstalk increases PD-L1 generation, promoting the\nactivity of PD-L1 + exosomes in cancer immunotherapy [477].\nAlthough PD-L1 + exosomes have carcinogenic func- tions, other exosomes can suppress PD-L1 expression. Considering the ability of exosomes to induce cancer immunotherapy, they may be utilized as potential vac- cines in the future. Cancer-derived exosomes exhibit superior capabilities in dendritic cell maturation and MHC cross-presentation, compared to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Furthermore, exosomes can reduce Treg cell numbers in cancer immunotherapy by suppress- ing PD-L1 expression [478]. This insight suggests that bioengineered exosomes, specifically designed to target dendritic cells, may serve as effective vaccines in can- cer therapy. Although the discussion on bioengineered exosomes is reserved for the next section, it is notewor- thy that cells can be engineered to secrete exosomes for cancer immunotherapy. For example, the nuclei of can- cer cells introduced to M1 macrophages can lead to the secretion of chimeric exosomes, selectively accumulating in lymph nodes and priming T cells to stimulate immune reactions against cancer cells [479]. Therefore, exosomes are potential regulators of the immune system in cancer [480]. Exploring the regulation of exosome secretion and biogenesis from cells opens new avenues for controlling cancer immunotherapy.\nBioengineered exosomes\nExosomes are used in cancer therapy because they are naturally present in the body, making it less likely for them to be identified as foreign and cleared. Their high biocompatibility allows effective cargo delivery and test- ing in clinical trials. Dying cancer cell-derived exosomes, modified with MART-1 peptide and CCL22-siRNA, induce T cell-mediated responses and suppress Treg expansion [481]. Bioengineered exosomes can produce persistent immunity against cancer cells, and this paves the way for the development of bio-based vaccines. Bio- engineered exosomes, painted with HMGB1, stimulate dendritic cells, enhance immunogenicity, and induce long-term immunity against cancer. These exosomes accumulate in lymphoid tissues and enhance T cell func- tion, inducing long-term immunity and suppressing cancer progression [482]. Another approach involves functionalizing exosomes via CpG DNA to stimulate dendritic cells and enhance antigen presentation, show- casing their co-delivery ability in synergistic cancer immunotherapy [483, 484].\nFusogenic exosomes have been synthesized to address cancer cells escaping the immune system due to self- recognition. These exosomes introduce viral antigens, stimulate dendritic cells, and present antigens to T lym- phocytes for CD8+ T cell cross-priming [485]. Exosomes from bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells, loaded with\ngalectin-9 siRNA and oxaliplatin, induce immunogenic cell death, recruit T lymphocytes, reduce Treg cells, and promote M1 polarization of macrophages, contrib- uting to cancer immunotherapy [486]. Engineered M1 macrophage-derived exosomes, targeting TAMs with IL4RPep-1, NF- B p50 siRNA, and miR-511-3p, induce cancer immunotherapy by reprogramming macrophages and restricting cancer proliferation [487]. Considered as biocompatible carriers, exosomes may be used to mod- ify other nanoparticles. Combining exosomes and lipo- somes enhances gene delivery, suppresses CD47 signal, and increases CD8+ T cell potential. This strategy has the potential for clinical applications in cancer immunother- apy [488]. Table 4 is a summary of the use of exosomes in cancer immunotherapy.\nStimuli-responsive nanostructures for cancer immunotherapy pH-sensitive nanostructures\nSmart nanoparticles responsive to TME stimuli may be used to generate targeted delivery systems. Their multi- functionality stems from changing structures in response to TME stimuli, facilitating cargo release at the tumor site. The TME, because of its acidic pH, is distinctive from normal cells, making pH-sensitive nanoparticles ideal for cancer immunotherapy. Nanoparticles have been synthesized using a PLA-b-PEG core and a cytosine (C)-rich i-motif DNA surface to produce the so-called nanovaccines. They are used to deliver cyclic dinucleo- tides such as cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (CDG) to endosomes, accelerating anti-tumor immunity and preventing TME immunosuppression. In TME s mild acidic pH, a conformational switch releases cargo, while physiological pH minimally increases CDG release. These pH-sensitive nanoparticles protect CDG from enzymatic degradation, releasing the cargo into the cytoplasm, and stimulating polarization of macrophages into the M1 phenotype [504].\nA groundbreaking achievement in cancer immuno- therapy involves the creation of prodrug nanoparticles for cargo delivery. These nanoparticles release cargo in response to the pH of the TME. An innovative self- cascaded unimolecular prodrug was designed, com- prising an acidic pH-activatable doxorubicin, and an aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) pho- tosensitizer linked to a caspase-3-responsive peptide. This engineered prodrug exhibits dual functionality- it can actively release doxorubicin in the acidic TME and initiate apoptosis-related caspase-3 activation. Further- more, the activated caspase-3 can induce the release and in-situ aggregation of photosensitizers. This process enhances dendritic cell maturation, increases CD8+ T cell numbers, and prevents metastasis to lung tissue [505].\nr e f e R\ne c n e\n] 9 8 4 [\n] 0 9 4 [\n] 1 9 4 [\n] 2 9 4 [\n] 3 9 4 [\n] 4 9 4 [\n] 5 9 4 [\n] 6 9 4 [\n] 7 9 4 [\n] 8 9 4 [\n] 9 9 4 [\n] 0 0 5 [\n] 1 0 5 [\n] 2 0 5 [\n] 3 0 5 [\nk r a m e R\ns e s n o p s e r e n u m m\ni\nl l\ne c -

For example, poly(L-histidine) (PHIS) has been used to encapsulate R848, forming pH-sensitive PHIS/R848 nanocores. Con- jugating doxorubicin to hyaluronic acid creates prodrug nanoparticles that coat PHIS/R848. These nanocarriers undergo a switch from hydrophobic to hydrophilic in response to pH change, releasing R848 to modulate the immune system. At pH 5.5, the hydrazone bond cleaves, releasing doxorubicin. The latter is internalized into tumor cells via endocytosis. This activates the immune system and suppresses cancer proliferation [506].\nimmune cell infiltration, dendritic cell stimulation, and T cell recruitment for cancer immunotherapy [511]. Table 5 summarizes the application of pH-sensitive nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy.\nRedox-sensitive nanoparticles\nRedox-sensitive nanoparticles are carriers that release cargo in response to redox imbalances in the TME. The development of these nanoparticles involves introducing redox-sensitive bonds, such as disulfide bonds. They have found application in cancer immunotherapy, capable of stimulating various immune cells.\nMetal-based nanoparticles can also be designed to decompose in response to TME pH. A human serum albumin-coated zeolite imidazolate framework-8 has been developed for the delivery of a photosensitizer (HPZ), for selective recognition of the TME [507]. This framework enables rapid elevation of zinc ion concentra- tions while ensuring controlled release of the encapsu- lated photosensitizer. Under physiological pH (7.4), HPZ exhibits a size of approximately 170 nm, decreasing sig- nificantly to less than 10 nm in acidic conditions (pH 6.5). The acid-induced decomposition of HPZ prompts a swift increase in zinc ion concentration, exerting potent cyto- toxic effects against colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Intravenous administration of HPZ in a CT26 tumor-bearing mouse model results in the expansion of T helper and cytotoxic T cells, and reduction in the Treg cell population. These changes lead to a significant inhi- bition of tumor growth.\nMultifunctional nanocarriers with redox-sensitive fea- tures, comprising toll-like receptor agonists, catalase, and PD-L1-siRNA, have been designed for cancer therapy. These nanoparticles induce M1 polarization of macro- phages, increase ROS production, downregulate PD-L1 expression, and enhance CD8+ T cell functions by sup- pressing Treg cells [525].\nClinical application of immunotherapy hinges on using biocompatible and long-term safe nanostructures like micelles. Micelles containing doxorubicin and R848, a TLR7/8 agonist, were experimentally used as nanovac- cines. Elevated glutathione levels in the TME trigger micelle decomposition, releasing cargo and inducing immunogenic cell death, dendritic cell stimulation, and accelerated immune responses. Additionally, redox- responsive polymers and an A2AR antagonist within micelles suppress adenosinergic signaling to activate NK and CD8+ T cells in cancer immunotherapy [526].\nWhile the primary focus of this section is to assess the role of nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy, it is worth mentioning that microneedle arrays, composed of tiny needles, can also be used for sustained cargo deliv- ery. pH-sensitive nanoparticles can be incorporated into microneedles, facilitating sustained release for hyperac- tivating the immune system and creating nanovaccines [508]. Hydrogels are also available for sustained cargo delivery. For example, nanoparticles can be embedded in pH-sensitive hydrogels for delivering doxorubicin and JQ1 (a small molecular inhibitor) to induce immu- nogenic cell death [509]. Of note, pH-sensitive biomi- metic nanocarriers, crafted from PLGA and coated with membranes from macrophages and cancer cells, can deliver FGL1-siRNA and metformin for cancer immuno- therapy. These biomimetic nanoparticles enhance cargo endosomal escape, with metformin suppressing PD-L1 through AMPK upregulation, and siRNA reducing FGL1 expression to boost anti-cancer immunity through T cell induction [510]. Given the impact of TME pH on tumori- genesis, pH regulators have been developed. Calcium carbonate nanostructures neutralize TME pH by con- suming lactate, promoting M1 macrophage polarization,\nCationic polymer dots, known for their small particle size, imaging capabilities, and drug delivery potential, have seen extensive use in biomedicine. PEI600-modified redox-sensitive hyperbranched poly(amido amine) nano- structures, partially carbonized with polymer dots, were used for carrying ovalbumin. These structures enhance splenocyte proliferation, elevate cytokine levels (includ- ing IL-12 and IFN- ), promote dendritic cell maturation, and increase CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, as well as T lymphocytes. Ovalbumin release from these structures is redox-responsive [527].\nGiven that both pH and redox serve as endogenous stimuli, new nanocarriers have been developed that exhibit dual responsiveness. pH- and redox-sensitive micelles containing ovalbumin, modified with PLH-PEG, are used as cancer vaccines. These micellar nanostruc- tures enable cytosolic delivery of ovalbumin through redox release, proton influx, micelle disassembly, and ultimately, a proton sponge effect and lysosome break. These micelles enhance MHC-I rates, antigen presenta- tion, lymph node accumulation, and improve immune reactions [528].\nPhoto-responsive nanoparticles and phototherapy\nLight serves as an exogenous stimulus in nanoparticle development, where laser irradiation induces bond cleav- age to release the loaded cargo. This forms the basis of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal ther- apy (PTT) for cancer ablation. In PDT, ROS production induces cell death, while PTT causes cell death through hyperthermia. Combining phototherapy with immuno- therapy can enhance cancer suppression. Two methods are utilized, including a combination of phototherapy and immunotherapy or stimulation of phototherapy- mediated immunotherapy. Both methods offer a high likelihood of tumor suppression, improving the fight against cancer. PLGA nanoparticles loaded with R837, docetaxel, and PB agents are used for immunotherapy and PTT. These nanoparticles are modified with cancer cell membranes for enhanced effectiveness. R837 stimu- lates dendritic cell maturation, and docetaxel increases M1 polarization of macrophages, impairing the immuno- suppressive TME. This leads to increased infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the TME for effective cancer immunotherapy [529].\nSimilar to doxorubicin, which induces immunogenic cell death, docetaxel has shown potential in cancer immunotherapy by regulating TAM polarization. CuS nanoparticles with NH2 functional groups, function- alized with folic acid and conjugated to PEI-PpIX for enhanced solubility, deliver docetaxel and CpG, inducing PTT and immunotherapy. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent photothermal conversion ability upon exposure to 650 and 808 nm laser irradiation and induce M1 polar- ization of macrophages through the function of docetaxel in cancer immunotherapy [530].\nBeyond combining immunotherapy and PTT, it is pos- sible to induce immune reactions resulting from PTT. Tumor cell killing and antigen release can accelerate immune reactions. A peptide-photosensitizer conjugate, developed from anti-PD-L1 peptide, cleavable by MMP- 2, and purpurin 18 as a photosensitizer, accumulates in the tumor site. MMP-2 enzyme degradation releases the peptide, causing antigen release. Irradiation induces dendritic cell maturation, migrating into lymph nodes, increasing T cell infiltration, suppressing metastasis to lung tissue, and eliciting anti-tumor immune responses [531].\nPhoto-responsive structures can also function as vac- cines. Chelation of Fe3+ ions with ovalbumin leads to biomineralization into nanovaccines, embedding IR820 as a photosensitizer through electrostatic incorpora- tion. The presence of iron induces ferroptosis, mediat- ing immunogenic cell death. Immunogenic cell death stimulates neoantigens and DAMPs, synergizing with ovalbumin in cancer immunotherapy. Near-infrared irra- diation induces PTT, enhancing immunotherapy. These\nnanostructures enhance T cell infiltration, inhibit the primary tumor, and show promising impacts in combina- tion with checkpoint inhibitors [532].\nThe combination of PDT and immunotherapy has shown promising results in cancer immunotherapy. Although PDT and PTT have different mechanisms of action, both can be combined with immunotherapy to expedite the immunotherapeutic process by expos- ing antigens or inducing cell death to stimulate immune responses. Photodynamic therapy is preferred over PTT due to potential hyperthermia effects on normal tissues. However, when tumor-targeted nanoparticles are devel- oped, they can precisely execute PDT in the tumor site, effectively killing cancer cells. Various nanoenzymes with cancer cell accumulation can be developed to induce PDT and enhance cancer immunotherapy.\nA nanoparticle core was created by connecting pacli- taxel drugs through a disulfide bond (PTX-SS-PTX), with P18 as a photosensitizer connected to MPEG- CPPA-b-P(M4). In response to glutathione, the disul- fide bond degrades, and laser irradiation in response to ROS increases singlet oxygen generation, releasing high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) due to GSDME activa- tion. HMGB1 releases and pyroptosis induction leads to dendritic cell maturation, educating na ve T cells in lymph nodes, expanding T cells, and developing memory T cells for cancer immunotherapy [533].\nFor PDT stimulation, the photosensitizer is loaded into nanoparticles. Recent studies have shown the potential of herbal medicine in cancer treatment. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles modified with PEG can carry both chlorin e6 and astragaloside III, stimulating NK cells and sup- pressing cancer cell growth. These nanoparticles accumu- late in the tumor site, increasing immune cell infiltration, promoting the activity and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and impairing tumorigenesis [534].\nLiposomes are also potential nanocarriers in cancer immunotherapy. Liposomes carrying IPI-549 as a PI3K  inhibitor and chlorin e6 as a photosensitizer induce ROS generation after irradiation, facilitating immuno- genic cell death and improving the potential of T lym- phocytes in eliminating cancer cells. IPI-549 delivery by nanoparticles can decrease arginase-1 (Arg-1) and ROS levels, increasing apoptosis in MDSCs, and preventing their suppressive function on T cells. In addition, these nanoparticles decrease the infiltration of M2-polarized macrophages and mature dendritic cells in cancer immu- notherapy [535].\nIn both nanoparticle-mediated PDT and PTT, the most prominent mechanism is the stimulation of immu- nogenic cell death to accelerate cancer immunother- apy. Increasing evidence highlights the application of nanoparticle-mediated phototherapy and immunother- apy in cancer suppression [536 540].

Figure 6 shows the application of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers in cancer immunotherapy. Since the pre-clinical stud- ies demonstrate the function of nanoparticles for can- cer immunotherapy and tumor suppression, the clinical application of nanostructures in cancer immunotherapy has been performed to evaluate their potential [541].

The PLGA, PGA, PLG, PEG, PEI and chitosan nanoparticles have been widely used in cancer immunotherapy [566]. Moreover, such nanostructures have shown potential as immunostimulatory adjuvants in cancer immunotherapy [567 569]. Loading TLR7/8 agonists in PLGA nanostruc- tures enhanced levels of CD40, CD80, and CD86 through stimulation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and subcutaneous administration of such nanoparticles stim- ulated dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells [570].\nLipid nanoparticles\nLiposomes are among the promising nanocarriers for drugs, genes and vaccines [571]. Until now, multiple kinds of liposomal nanostructures including 1,2-dioleoyl- 3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), 3 - (N- [N , N -dimethyl aminoethane] - carbamoyl) cholesterol (DC-Chol), and dimethyl diocta decylammonium (DDA) [572, 573] have been significantly applied for the antigen exposure to APCs and providing vaccine adjuvants to increase antigen-specific immune reactions [574, 575]. The dextran-functionalized liposomes with pH-sensitiv- ity activity have shown high uptake by dendritic cells and they can provide cytosol delivery of ovalbumin to accel- erate antigen-specific immune reactions and impair can- cer progression [576]. Furthermore, loading CpG-ODNs as TLR9 agonist and 3,5-didodecyloxybenzamidine as an adjuvant into liposomes can enhance dendritic cell- mediated cytokine production to enhance antigen-spe- cific immunity [521]. Micelles are among another kind of lipid nanoparticles that can function as delivery systems for antigen/adjuvant to improve potential of vaccines. The polymeric hybrid micelles have been utilized for the delivery of CpG-ODN and Trp2 to create a nanovac- cine for targeting lymph nodes and enhancing the accu- mulation of cargo in dendritic cells, triggering CD8+ T\ncell-mediated immune responses and enhancing cancer suppression (melanoma) [577].\nCarbon nanoparticles\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been shown to medi- ate immunostimulatory impacts in vitro and in vivo. The oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have shown the ability for the delivery of cancer-testis antigen, known as NY-ESO-1 and CpG-ODNs. These structures showed uptake by dendritic cells and mediated power- ful CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-driven immune reactions to impair melanoma progression [578]. Furthermore, the co-delivery of ovalbumin and CpG-ODN, as well as anti- CD40 Ig as immunoadjuvants by MWCNTs has shown potential in accelerating T cell responses and suppressing melanoma progression [579].,\nMetal nanoparticles\nGold nanostructures are promising factors in cancer immunotherapy owing to their characteristics, including biocompatibility, adjustable surface chemistry, and ease of controlling size and shape [580]. The gold nanostruc- tures have shown potential in inducing differentiation of macrophages into dendritic-like cells to enhance T cell proliferation and promote cytokine release [581]. Fur- thermore, the gold nanostructures have shown incred- ible potential to act as adjuvants for enhancing antibody generation [582]. The potential of gold nanoparticles in cancer therapy via TME modulation has been revealed [583, 584]. The surface of hollow gold nanostructures has been functionalized with CpG-ODNs to enhance their cellular uptake and enhance function in the induction of immune responses, including enhancing TNF-  secre- tion [585]. The silica nanoparticles have also been applied widely in biomedicine for imaging [586], specific target- ing of cancer [587], and delivery of drugs and genes [588]. The mesoporous silica nanoparticles have been applied for antigen delivery and acted as vaccines to induce humoral- and cell-driven immune reactions while having high biocompatibility and lacking toxicity [589]. The hol- low mesoporous silica nanoparticles have been shown to be biodegradable and are capable of TME remodeling in cancer immunotherapy [361]. According to these studies, various categories of nanostructures demonstrate prom- ising characteristics in cancer immunotherapy, and all of them have shown potential in TME remodeling. The next step for the clinical application of these nanocarriers depends on their biocompatibility and long-term safety that lipid nanoparticles are at the front line.\nand survival rates. However, challenges persist in the utilization of adjuvants and immunomodulatory agents. This prompted the exploration of novel solutions, par- ticularly through the application of nanoparticles. The intricate interactions within the TME play a pivotal role in influencing cancer cell responses to immunother- apy. In this context, nanoparticles designed for targeted delivery of immunomodulatory compounds and TME remodeling have emerged as promising tools in cancer immunotherapy.\nNanoparticles address the current challenges in cancer immunotherapy by demonstrating the capability to regu- late TME components, altering the trajectory of tumor cell progression, and mitigating the immunosuppres- sive milieu in cancer. Nanostructures designed for TME remodeling can increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, stimulate dendritic cells, induce M1 macrophage polarization, and inhibit MDSCs. Furthermore, nanopar- ticles serve as effective carriers for delivering adjuvants and other immunomodulatory compounds, such as drugs or genes, in cancer immunotherapy.\nA significant breakthrough in nanoparticle develop- ment for cancer immunotherapy lies in the creation of biomimetic nanocarriers, incorporating functional- ized membranes derived from red blood cells, tumor- associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and tumor cells. In addition, the utilization of exo- somes, whether naturally secreted by cells or bioengi- neered in the laboratory, holds promise in regulating the immune system in cancer therapy. Nanoparticles exhibit the capacity to diminish the number of Treg cells and MDSCs, preventing immunosuppression. Moreover, nanoparticle-induced immunogenic cell death promotes the activation of dendritic cells, facilitating their migra- tion into lymph nodes to stimulate T cells for cancer immunotherapy.\nStimuli-responsive nanocarriers, particularly pH- and redox-sensitive nanoparticles, enhance the potential of cancer immunotherapy. Photo-responsive nanoparticles, through photothermal and photodynamic therapy, con- tribute to the augmentation of cancer immunotherapy by inducing immunogenic cell death, regulating dendritic cells and T cells, and promoting M1 polarization of mac- rophages. This multifaceted approach highlights the ver- satility and promise of nanoparticles in advancing cancer immunotherapy.\nConclusion and challenges Cancer immunotherapy and the development of vaccines have ushered in a new era in cancer treatment, instilling hope in patients and significantly enhancing prognosis\nThe clinical application of nanoparticles involves sev- eral crucial considerations [590]. Once we comprehend the potential of nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy, translation of these technologies, advancements, and findings to the clinical setting becomes imperative.

Evaluation of delivering immunomodulatory agents alongside chemotherapy drugs should be conducted to determine the synergistic impact on cancer therapy.

One of the most prominent draw- backs is that currently developed nanoplatforms are in phase I or II. The present review provided the possible interaction and function of nanoparticles with TME components and immune cells to induce cancer immu- notherapy that can be used in clinics. In most cases, ani- mal models have been utilized to evaluate the potential of nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy, making it hard to translate to humans. The selection of humanized animal models can improve the chance of translation into the clinic. Moreover, the appropriate nanoparticles should be chosen for cancer immunotherapy. In this way, it is suggested to use FDA-approved agents such as polymers or lipid nanoparticles to accelerate the pace of clinical translation and immune regulation. The biosafety, tolerability, and reproducibility of nanocarriers should also be considered for clinical application. In recent years, a high number of nanoparticles have been intro- duced into clinics for the treatment of cancers, including lipid-based nanoparticles (generic name: JVRS-100) for the treatment of leukemia (NCT00860522), liposomes for the treatment of lymphoma, melanoma, breast, ovar- ian and prostate cancers (NCT03349450, NCT01052142, NCT01095848), PLGA nanoparticles for the treatment of metastatic melanoma (NCT01753089) and colloidal gold structures for the treatment of advanced solid tumors [592]. However, all of these nanoparticles have been eval- uated in phase I and II studies.\n) d e u n i t n o c (\n6 e l b a T\n/ e p y t\nr e c n a C\ne l c i t r a p o n a N\ne n\ni l\nl l\ne C\nt s a e r B\no h p s o h p k c a B l\n1 T 4 / r e c n a c\nt o d m u t n a u q s u r\ns l l\ne c\ns e c i s e v o n a n\nl\n/ r e c n a c n o o C\nl\ns e g a c o n a n d o G\nl\ns l l\ne c 6 2 T C\nTaking everything together, there are a number of points that should be considered for the application of nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy [593]. Cur- rently, cancer immunotherapy is mainly based on the application of nano-scale delivery systems for con- including immunotherapeutic compounds, ventional antibodies, recombinant proteins, and small molecular- based immune agonist, adjuvant, or inhibitor. The ratio- nale for the application of nanoparticles is to improve immunotherapeutic the pharmacokinetic profile of\nFig. 6 Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers in cancer immunotherapy. Nanoparticles that respond to pH, redox, or light can release cargo to induce apoptosis, DNA damage, and regulation of molecular pathways. Moreover, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers stimulate immunogenic cell death to increase dendritic cell maturation. They migrate into lymph nodes and increase activation of T cells\nTable 7 The application of nanoparticle-based immunotherapy in clinical studies [541, 555 557] Nanoparticle RNA-lipoplexes\nPhase Phase I\nRemark Increasing maturation of dendritic cells and increasing T cell response Reduction in the expression of immune evasion genes Stimulation of neoantigen-specific T cells and increasing anti- cancer immune responses Increasing M1 polarization of macrophages from M2 phenotype\nmiR-34a-loaded liposomes miR-4157-loaded lipids\nPhase I Phase I\nIron oxide nanostructures\nNot applicable Phase II Phase II\nPaclitaxel-loaded lipid core nanostructures Doxorubicin-loaded anti-EGFR immunoliposomes\nEnhancing dendritic cell maturation Stimulation of immunogenic cell death Suppressing EGFR-induced growth signaling Stimulation of the immune system Increase in tumor cell death, promotion of immunogenic cell death, and induction of the immune system\nPlasmid DNA complex-loaded cationic liposomes Combination of anti-PD-1 and hafnium oxide nanostructures\nPhase I Phase I\nReference [558]\n[559] [560]\n[256]\n[561, 562] NCT02833766\nNCT00860522 NCT03589339 [563]\nagents, diminish the side impacts, prevent the cytokine storm by immune hyperactivation, and ameliorate defi- ciency in immune responses. Moreover, nanoparticles are promising for reversing immunosuppression and preventing immune evasion. Although this is an inter- disciplinary field combining biology and engineering, a number of factors should be carefully investigated,\nincluding nanoparticle-mediated immunogenicity, bio- compatibility and engineering aspects regarding thera- peutic compound loading in nanostructures. Moreover, several nanoparticles have anti-cancer activity, caus- ing synergistic impact with immunotherapeutics. One of the most important features of nanoparticles is their ability for controlled release of therapeutics.

Therefore, the delivery of therapeutics should be per- formed in a controlled manner and safe levels should be delivered. Moreover, the rapid or burst release of immu- notherapy compounds is not effective in providing long- term anti-cancer immunity. A number of nanoparticles are promising for the controlled release of therapeutic compounds, including PLGA nanostructures that, upon degradation of the polymer, the release of the immuno- therapeutic compound occurs [594, 595]. Biocompatibil- ity has been another important factor in pre-clinical and clinical studies [596]. Along with controlling the toxicity of immunomodulatory factors, including recombinant cytokines [597 599], the physicochemical characteris- tics of nanostructures including size, shape and thermal conversion ability, among others, should be adjusted in a manner to reduce the side effects of nanoparticles [600, 601]. In this way, the toxicity of nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo, hemocompatibility, effect on major organs including liver and kidney, and metabolic pathways should be investigated [602]. The surface functionaliza- tion of nanoparticles is another important factor in can- cer immunotherapy. The surface functionalization can affect the intracellular uptake of nanostructures and even their processing [603]. Furthermore, since nanoparticles have been applied for antigen capture, the surface charge, hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity can change the func- tion of nanostructures in cancer immunotherapy [299]. Another factor is that the nanostructures can specifically target the lymphoid tissues or immune cells to enhance the potential of drugs in cancer immunotherapy [604]. Polymeric nanoparticles have shown high potential in vascular escape, infiltration into tissues and lymphatics and targeting lymphocytes, while liposomes show high uptake by phagocytic cells, including macrophages [603]. In addition, these nanoparticles demonstrate high safety along with capacity in cancer immunotherapy [605  608]. Notably, the nanoparticles can be considered as immune potentiates in which metal nanoparticles, virus- like nanostructures and other categories can stimulate immune responses through induction of B and T cells [603, 609] that is highly dependent on the size and sur- face charge of nanostructures [366, 610, 611]. However, carbon nanostructures have shown immunosuppressive impacts in some cases [612, 613]. Therefore, the intro- duction of nanoparticles for thr purpose of cancer immu- notherapy is of importance.\nAbbreviations ICIs TME NFAT TOX\nNR4A\nImmune Checkpoint Inhibitors Tumor Microenvironment

Most of the current vaccines and those in development focus on targeting the viral spike proteins by generating antibodies of varying spectrum. These vaccines represent a variety of platforms including whole virus vaccines, viral vector vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines representing RNA, DNA, and their hybrid forms.\nThe therapeutic ef cacy of these vaccines varies owing to their pharmacodynamic individualities. COVID-19 variants are capable of inducing different pathologic responses and some of which may be resistant to antibodies generated by current vaccines. The current clinical use of these vaccines has been through emergency use authorization until recently. Moreover, the ef cacy and safety of these vaccines have been tested in substantial numbers of individuals but studies in special populations that better re ect the global population are pending results. These specialized populations include young children, immunocompromised patients, preg- nant individuals, and other specialized groups. Combination approaches, molecularly modi ed vaccination approaches, and vaccines conferring longer periods of immunity are being currently being investigated, as well as pharmacovigilance studies.\nThe continual transformation of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are of concern along with the breakthrough infections. These con- siderations pose new challenges for the development of vaccination platforms. For this purpose, booster doses, combination vaccine approaches, and other modalities are being discussed. This review provides an updated account of currently available vaccines and those in advanced development with reference to their composition and mechanisms of action.\nA discussion on the use of vaccines in special populations including immunocompromised patients, pregnant women and other\nspecialized populations are also included.\nKeywords COVID-19 vaccines, COVID-19 variants, children and adolescents, pregnancy and lactation, immunocomprimised patients\nDate received: 31 August 2021; revised: 25 September 2021; accepted: 13 October 2021.\nIntroduction\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS- CoV-2) has been detected in more than 206 million people and has caused more than 4.3 million deaths worldwide and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a signi cant global health problem.1 After its  rst appearance in late December of 2019, it was  rst reported as\n1Cardiovascular Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL, USA 2Campbell University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Campbell University, Buies Creek, NC, USA 3Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL, USA 4AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA 5Ligocki Dental Group, Oak Brook, IL, USA 6Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey 7Sorbonne Universit , Assistance Publique-H pitaux de Paris, Thrombosis Center, Service D H matologie Biologique H pital Tenon, Paris, France\nCorresponding Author: Bulent Kantarcioglu, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago, Health Sciences Division, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.

Although the target organ for the virus was initially thought to be the lungs, it has been recog- nized that binding to the through angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptors expressed on target cells, COVID-19 can affect almost all of the organ systems.4 6 Most of the patients present with mild symptoms, however, a considerable subset of patients develop a more severe condition, varying from pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to multi-organ failure (MOF).7 9 The coagulation abnormalities and immunological syndromes that occur during the course of the disease can cause life threat- ening events, leading to signi cant morbidity and mortality.10  13 After more than a year of living with COVID-19, many fea- tures of the disease have been revealed, but there are still many unknowns such as lack of a curative treatment of the disease or the importance of new emerging variants over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.14 While simple prevention measures such as using masks, physical distancing or hygiene can only slow down the pandemic, vaccines are the most powerful tools to  ght against COVID-19.15 Currently there are some 19 clinically used vaccines which have been used to control COVID-19 infections and over 100 in various phases of devel- opment. Thus, global vaccination will be of paramount impor- tance in the management of this pandemic.\nendothelial\nlining,\nThe discovery of the vaccination is one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. The eradication of smallpox is one of the best examples of how vaccination stopped a deadly disease and saved millions of lives. The vaccinations against tetanus and rabies are similar examples. Many childhood infec- tions such as polio and measles also became preventable. Millions of lives have been saved by annual in uenza vaccina- tions.16,17 Vaccines are complex biological products that need to be applied in large populations of healthy people. Due to this, the development of vaccines takes a long period of time. Generally, development of any vaccine often takes 15 years or more from the initial design stage to the clinical studies.18 Vaccine clinical trials are often expensive and require recruit- ment of large numbers of volunteers with different ethnicities, ages, and health conditions. Long-term monitoring is also nec- essary to establish vaccine ef cacy and to rule out or identify rare safety issues.\nThe development of the vaccines against COVID-19 started as soon as the virus genome was published in early January 2020.19,20 Immense resources have been deployed to support vaccine development by thousands of researchers, using highly sophisticated technology, and spending huge amounts of  nancial resources. Eventually, several different vaccines were deployed by late December 2020, under emergency use authorization, and mass vaccination campaigns have com- menced all around the world. The fact that several COVID-19 vaccine candidates entered into clinical trials in less than 6 months and were approved for emergency use in less than 10 months since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, devel- opment of COVID-19 vaccines demonstrates a ground- breaking speed in vaccine development history. Despite this\nClinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis\nhigh speed, safety standards for the development and approval process of these vaccines were consistent with those of previ- ously developed vaccines, with rigorous review of their clinical data by higher health authorities such as the World Health for Disease Organization (WHO) or United States Center Control and Prevention (US-CDC). Beside the availability of vaccines, the control of this epidemic will require greater than 80% vaccination of the global population. Additionally, uniform- ity in the vaccination programs in various parts of the word is equally important. Most of the currently used vaccines have been approved in a fast-tracked emergency process and autho- rized for emergency use. Only the P zer vaccine has full approval as of August 24, 2021 by the US-FDA. Other widely used vaccines are likely to receive similar approvals from the US-FDA and European Medicine Agency in the near future.\nimmunity against SARS-CoV-2 by generating neutralizing antibodies through molecularly de ned mechanisms. All vaccines are capable of triggering the endogenous generation of spike protein which in turn result in the formation of neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses to COVID-19. The generation of these neutraliz- ing antibodies provide protection against viral infection by readily complexing with the COVID-19 virus and arresting its propagation and subsequent pathophysiologic manifestation. The spike proteins generated by different approaches result in the formation of COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies with differ- ential duration of fraction and antiviral spectrum.\nCurrrently used vaccines provide\nFigure 1 shows a comparison of whole virion COVID-19 vaccines and viral vector vaccines. Whole virion vaccines are usually derived from chemically or molecularly modi ed SARS-CoV-2. The viral vector vaccines are derived by recom- bination of genomic sequence encoding trimeric form of spike protein. Figure 2 shows an illustration of the nucleic acid vac- cines with recombinant protein based vaccines. Nucleic acid vaccines are based on mRNA and DNA vaccines. mRNA vac- cines represent the genetic sequence of S protein. The DNA vaccines use the plasmids as vectors to transcript S protein. The recombinant protein based vaccines employ prokaryotic cells to produce recombinant spike protein or viral particles. Additional vaccines which are currently under development will have broader targets beside the generation of spike protein which include nucleocapsid protein and other viral antigens.\nIt is important to note that vaccination of at least 60-80% of the world population is required to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19.21 23 According to WHO, more than 4 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally.24 However, vaccination rates are far less than would be necessary to control the pandemic, especially in Africa and Southeast Asian countries. Vaccination programs widely differ due to  nancial and logistics constraints throughout the world with a direct impact on the prevalence of COVID-19 infections.25 Additionally, public acceptance of vaccines and vaccine hesitancy have become growing concerns for the success of vaccination programs.26 29 The duration of protec- tion of COVID-19 vaccines or requirement of a booster dose\nKantarcioglu et al.\nFigure 1.

For this reason, in this manuscript, we tried to update and summarize the current status of COVID-19 vaccinations in the light of current literature.\nthem have also become important\nVaccine Development for COVID-19\nMost of the vaccine candidates for COVID-19 were designed to induce neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike (S) protein to prevent its binding to the human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor which mediates entrance of the virus into the human cells. The S protein is a fusion\nglycoprotein that is divided into two functionally distinct parts (S1 and S2). S1 is located on the virus surface and contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that speci - cally binds to the host cell receptor. The transmembrane S2 domain contains the fusion peptide, which mediates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Besides the S protein, SARS-CoV-2 has other structural proteins such as membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) pro- teins. Antibodies that target M and E proteins have failed to neutralize the COVID-19 infection. For this reason, these 2 proteins are currently not considered as target antigen for COVID-19 vaccines. On the other hand, N protein is also highly immunogenic and can induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses.31 33\nFollowing the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a worldwide race to develop vaccines against this\n3\n4\nClinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis\nFigure 2.

By August 2021, a total of 296 COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been developed, with 112 in clinical trials and 184 in preclinical studies.34 Many different vaccine tech- nology platforms have been used to develop a safe and effective vaccine, including conventional whole virus vaccines (live attenuated or inactivated vaccines), viral vector vaccines (non- replicating and replicating), nucleic acid vaccines (DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines) and recombinant protein-based vac- cines [protein subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLP)].31 33\nVaccine Platforms and Currently Available Vaccines\nWhole Virus Vaccines Whole virus vaccines are classi ed as inactivated and live- attenuated vaccines. They are the oldest and most well- established types of vaccine, used in smallpox, BCG, and measles vaccines. The technology used in this platform is decades old and is proven. Due to the presence of the whole virus with a variety of viral surface antigens, these vaccines cause a diverse immunologic response. The manufacturing\nprocess of these vaccines requires handling live virus prepara- tions. For this reason, a high level of bio-safety installations is needed for their production.35 41\nLive-attenuated vaccines are produced by serial passage of the pathogen virus in cell cultures for selection of a reduced rep- lication potential and thus reduced virulence. The virulence of these viruses in live-attenuated vaccines is reduced, but they can still replicate. These vaccines usually produce strong and long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immune responses by infection, but strict safety evaluation is mimicking natural required. Normally, live-attenuated viral vaccines do not cause disease, however they can be the source of infection when they are used in immunocompromised patients due to the presence of live viruses in the vaccine. Inactivated vaccines contain inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. They are usually inac- tivated by chemicals formaldehyde and beta- propiolactone, so that the antigenicity of the viral surface com- ponents is retained. Because they cannot replicate, they cannot cause infections even in the immunocompromised individuals. They are safer and more stable than live attenuated vaccines. These vaccines generally require multiple doses or adjuvants to achieve immunity.35 41\nsuch as\ns l a i r T\nl a c i n\ni l\nC n\ni\ns e n i c c a V\n9 1 - D V O C n o i r i V\nI\ne o h W\nl\nt n e r r u C\n.\n1\ne b a T\nl\nl a c i n\ni l\nC\n& s e s o D\nl a v o r p p A\nf\no\ns u t a t S\nn o i t a u l a v E\ne t u o R\ne u d e h c S\nl\ny r t n u o C\nr e p o e v e D\nl\ne n i c c a V\ns e n i c c a V\nd e t a v i t c a n I\n)\nA\nd e v o r p p A\nd e v o r p p A\n4\n4\ne s a h P\ne s a h P\nM\nM\nI\nI\n4 1 + 0\n1 2 + 0\ny a D\ny a D\na n h C\ni\na n h C\ni\nf\no\ne t u t i t s n I\ng n\ni j i\ne B + o C p u o r G c e t o B\nd t L\n, .\no C\nt n e m p o e v e D d n a\ni\nl a n o i t a N a n h C +\nl\ni\nh c r a e s e R\nm r a h p o n S\nc a v o n S\ni\ni\nc a V a n o r o C\nV r o C - P B B B\nI\nd e v o r p p A\n3\ne s a h P\nM\nI\n1 2 + 0\ny a D\na n h C\ni\nf\no\ne t u t i t s n I\nn a h u\nW + o C p u o r G c e t o B\ni\nl a n o i t a N a n h C + m r a h p o n S\ns t c u d o r P\ni\nl a c i g o o B\nl\ni\ni\nV r o C - P B W\nI\nd e v o r p A\n3\ne s a h P\nM\nI\n4 1 + 0\ny a D\na i d n I\nd e t i\nm L\ni\ns t c u d o r P\nl a c i g o o B\nl\ni\nl a n o i t a n r e t n I\nh c e t o B\ni\nt a r a h B\nn x a v o C\ni\nd e v o r p p A\nd e v o r p p A\n3\n3\ne s a h P\ne s a h P\nM\nM\nI\nI\n8 2 + 0\n8 2 + 0\ny a D\ny a D\na n h C\ni\na n h C\ni\ns e c n e i c S\nl a c i d e M\nf\no\ny m e d a c A e s e n h C + y g o o B\nd t L\n, .\no C s t c u d o r P\ni\nl a c i g o o B\nl\nl\ni\ni\nl a c i d e M\ni a t g n a K n e h z n e h S\nf\no\ne t u t i t s n I\nC A V N O C K r o\nd e d i v o r p\nt o n\ni a h n M\ni\ne m a N\nd e v o r p p A\n3\ne s a h P\nM\nI\n4 1 + 0\ny a D\na i s s u R\ns e c n e i c S\nf\no\n) S M A C B M\nI (\ny m e d a c A n a i s s u R\n. t e y\nc a V i v o C\nd e v o r p p A\nd e v o r p p A\n3\n3 / 2\ne s a h P\ne s a h P\nM\nM\nI\nI\n1 2 + 0\n4 1 + 0\ny a D\ny a D\nn a t s i k a z a h K\nn a r I\nn a t s h k a z a K\nf\no\np e R\n, s\nm e b o r P\nl\ny t e f a S\nl a c i g o o B\nl\ni\nr o\nf\ne t u t i t s n I\nh c r a e s e R\no C\nl a i r t s u d n I\nd e m r a h P\na f i h S\n  n i - d i v o C z a Q\nn a r I V O C\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\n3\ne s a h P\nM\nI\n1 2 + 0\ny a D\n \ne c n a r F\nm o d g n K d e t i n U\ni\n,\nh c r a e s e R\nh t l a e H r o\nf\ne t u t i t s n I\nl a n o i t a N\n, a v e n l a V\n1 0 0 2 A L V\nA S U\n. t e y\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\nt o N\n3\n2 / 1\ne s a h P\ne s a h P\nM\nM\nI\nI\n1 2 + 0\n8 2 + 0\ny a D\ny a D\ny e k r u T\nA S U\n;\nH T A P\n; )\nO P G\n(\nn o i t a z i n a g r O\ny e k r u T\nl a c i t u e c a m r a h P\n, y t i s r e v i n U s e y i c r E\nt n e m n r e v o G e h T\nC A V - V O C U R E\nd e d i v o r p\nt o n\ne m a N\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\n2 / 1\ne s a h P\nM\nI\n8 2 + 0\ny a D\na n h C\ni\nd t L\n, .\nx a v a n y D\no C s c i g o o B M K\nl\ni\nd e d i v o r p\nt o n\n. t e y\ne m a N\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\n1\ne s a h P\nM\nI\n  /\n+ 4 1 + 0\ny a D\nn a r I\nh c r a e s e R\nd n a\nn o i t a v o n n I\ne v i s n e f e D\nf\no\nn o i t a z i n a g r O\n. t e y\nC A V A R H K A F\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\n1\ne s a h P\nM\nI\n1 2 + 0\n1 2\ny a D\ny e k r u T\ny e k r u T\n, a m r a F\nk a c o K\n)\nC A V M\nI\n(\n9 1 - k a   o K\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\n1\ne s a h P\nM\nI\n1 2 + 0\ny a D\ny e k r u T\ny e k r u T\nf\no\nl i c n u o C h c r a e s e R\nl a c i g o o n h c e T\nl\nd n a\nc   i t n e i c S\ne h T\nd e d i v o r p\nt o n\ne m a N\n)\nK A T B   T (\nI\n. t e y\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\n1\ne s a h P\nr o M\nI\n1 2 + 0\ny a D\no c i x e M\nx e M\ni v A o i r o t a r o b a L d e d i v o r p\nt o n\ne m a N\nN\nI\n. t e y\nd e t a u n e t t A e v i L\n) B\ns e n i c c a V\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\n1\ne s a h P\nN\nI\n8 2 + 0\nr o\n0\ny a D\ny a D\na i d n I\na i d n I\nf\no\ne t u t i t s n I\nm u r e S / x n e g a d o C\ni\nC A V - I V O C\n. t e y\nd e v o r p p a\nt o N\n1\ne s a h P\nN\nI\n0\ny a D\nA S U\n. c n I\n, s e n i c c a V\na s s i e M\n2 1 2 - 4 1 0 - V M\n5\n6\nAs depicted on Table 1, there are at least 19 whole virus COVID-19 vaccines or vaccine candidates that are registered in clinical trials.34 While nine of these inactivated vaccines are approved for general or emergency use in several countries, the development process of remaining vaccines are continuing in different stages of clinical trials.\nCoronavac is a propiolactone inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

There were no serious adverse events related to vaccination.44,45 China approved the vaccine for general use in February 2021. More recent reports have alluded to lower ef cacy of this vaccine.\nBBIBP-CorV and WIBP-CorV are propiolactone inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The inactivated virus was isolated from a patient in the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan. (HB02 and WIV04 Strains). The vaccine viruses were cultivated in quali ed Vero cell lines for propagation. In the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, a robust humoral immune response was observed in 100% of vaccine recipients.46,47 All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse events were reported within 28 days post vaccination for all cohorts. The Phase 3 clinical trials have been launched with these results. The interim results of the Phase 3 clinical trial in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, have been published showing an ef cacy of 78.1% for BBIBP-CorV and 72.8% for WIBP-CorV.48 Sinopharm CNGB announced that the vaccine has an ef cacy rate of 79.34%.39 China approved the vaccine for general use in December 2020.\na whole-virion inactivated SARSCoV- by Bharat Biotech International Limited. It has been designed with 2 adjuvant forms, using aluminum (Algel) or an imidazoquinoline mole- cule, which is a toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist absorbed to aluminum (Algel-IMDG). In the Phase 1 clinical trial, 375 participants have been enrolled. BBV152-Covaxin elicited ef - cient SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers and T cell responses.49 Local and systemic side effects were mild or mod- erate and were more frequent after the  rst dose. Only 1 serious adverse event (Viral Pneumonitis) has been reported, which was not related to the vaccine. In the Phase 2 clinical trial, 380 participants were enrolled.50 This study showed that BBV152-Covaxin has elicited high levels of neutralizing anti- bodies that remained elevated in all participants 3 months after the second vaccination. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 3 clinical trials started in December 2020 with these results. The results of this trial have not been published yet.

China approved Minhai in May 2021 and IMBCAMS vaccine in June 2021 for emergency use. QazCovid-in  has been approved by Kazakhstan for emer- gency use in April 2021. Iran approved the COVIran Barakat for emergency use in June 2021. Although these vaccines are registered in WHO vaccine tracker and clinicaltrials.gov, the results of these clinical trials for individual vaccines have not been published. CoviVac is another inactivated virus vaccine produced by the Chumakov Centre at the Russian Academy of Sciences. There is no mention of it at clinicaltrials.gov, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the WHO s vaccine tracker for CoviVac, but Russia approved CoviVac for emergency use in February 2021.51 57\nViral Vector Vaccines\nViral vector vaccines are based on live recombinant virus vectors that are either replicating or non-replicating. The non- replicating vector virus cannot replicate because the key genes of the vector virus have been disabled. Although, many different viral vectors are under investigation, non-replicating adenovirus (Ad) vectors are the most commonly employed viral vectors. Following the entry of the vector virus into the host cells, the viral vector integrates its genomic code into the host cell nucleus. Upon integration, the S protein antigen is pro- duced by the host cell itself. These expressed antigens generate strong humoral and cellular immune responses without the need of an adjuvant. Since viral vectors are common pathogens in nature, pre-existing immunity against the vector can reduce the effectiveness of these vaccines. For this reason, the vector strains that exhibit lower seroprevalence in humans (eg chim- panzee Ad, Ad5 and Ad26) are generally selected for vaccine development. In replicating vector virus vaccines, the vector virus has been attenuated to lose its pathogenic capacity and modi ed to carry SARS-CoV-2 genes, but it remains able to replicate in infected cells. Example of viruses that are used for replicating vector virus vaccines are lentivirus (LV), in u- enza virus (IFV), measles virus (MV), modi ed vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Due to the replicative potential of these vaccine viruses, they are highly immunogenic and gen- erate robust humoral and cellular-speci c immunity. Their use in intranasal formulations may produce better IgA formation and prevention of asymptomatic carriage. Given that they contain live viruses, there is a risk of disease in immunocom- promised individuals with their use.

Great care must be taken to keep cell cultures free of any contaminating material during their production.35 41\nAs illustrated on Table 2, there are at least 22 viral vector COVID-19 vaccines or vaccine candidates that are registered in clinical trials.34 While four of these inactivated vaccines are approved for general or emergency use in several countries, the development process of the remaining vaccines is continu- ing in different stages of clinical trials.\nvaccines. ChAdOx1-S, currently Non-replicating named as AZD1222, employs an Adenovirus derived from the chimpanzee. The use of a chimpanzee vector minimizes the possibility of interaction with preformed antibodies against adenoviruses. While the E1 deletion blocks the viral replication, the E3 deletion enables incorporation of larger genetic cargo into the viral vector. The added sequence encodes for the full-length S protein with a tissue plasminogen activator is codon-optimized.31 33 In the Phase I clinical trial, the results showed no severe side effects with ef cient humoral and cellu- lar immune responses.58,59 On the basis of these results, they launched Phase 2-3 trials. In a recent interim analysis of Phase 2-3 trials, the outcomes of 11,636 from 23,848 enrolled participants have been published.60,61 Overall vaccine ef cacy has been reported as 70.4%. Interestingly, while the ef cacy in participants who received two standard doses was 62.1%, the ef cacy in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose was 90.0%. In a 74,341 person/months of safety follow-up, 175 severe adverse events have been observed in 168 participants, 84 events in the AZD1222 group and 91 in the control group. However, only 3 events were initially consid- ered to be vaccine related. These events were: a case of transverse myelitis in vaccine group that the independent neurological com- mittee considered the most likely diagnosis to be idiopathic, a case of hemolytic anemia in the control group, and an individual who recorded fever higher than 40 C, but who recovered rapidly without an alternative diagnosis and was not admitted to hospital and remains masked to group allocation. There were four non-COVID-19 deaths reported across the studies (three in the control arm and one in the AZD1222 arm) that were all consid- ered unrelated to the vaccine.\nviral\nvector\nsignal\nsequence. The S protein sequence\nConvidecia is another non-replicating adenoviral (Ad5) vector vaccine encoding for the full-length S protein. The vaccine gene was derived from the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence for SARS-CoV2.

The vector encodes a full length and stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The vaccine gene was derived from the  rst clinical isolate of Wuhan strain.31 33 The safety and ef cacy have been studied in 805 participants in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.64 In these trials, regardless of vaccine dose or age group, neutralizing anti- body titers against the wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants with accompanying T cell responses. The results of Phase 3 clinical trials have been published.65 In January 2021, Johnson & Johnson announced that the ef - cacy of their vaccine is 72% in the USA, 64% in South Africa and 61% in Latin America. The local and systemic adverse events were mostly mild or moderate. Severe adverse events have been reported in 83 of vaccine recipients (N= 21,895) and 96 of placebo recipients (N=21,888). A numerical imbalance for venous thromboembolic events (11 in the vaccine group vs 3 in the placebo group) were observed. Deep venous thrombosis has been reported in 6 of the vaccine recipients and 2 of the placebo recipients. Pulmonary embolism has been reported in 4 of the vaccine recipients and 1 of the placebo recipients. Transverse sinus thrombosis has been reported in 1 of the vaccine recipients and none of the placebo recipients. Seizures have been reported in 4 of the vaccine recipients and 1 of the placebo recipients. Tinnitus has been reported in 6 of the vaccine recipients and none of the placebo recipients. For these imbalances, no causal relation- ship can be determined. Three deaths were reported in the vaccine group and 16 in the placebo group, all of which were considered by the investigators to be unrelated to the trial inter- vention. No deaths related to COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group, whereas 5 deaths related to COVID-19 were reported in the placebo group. Transverse sinus thrombosis with cerebral hemorrhage and a case of Guillain Barr  syn- drome were each seen in 1 vaccine recipient.

In the Phase 1 clinical trial, the vaccine showed high ef cacy with a low side effect pro le. The most common side effects were pain at the injection site, hyperthermia, headache, fatigue and muscle/joint pain. These adverse events were mostly mild, and no serious adverse events reported.66 The Phase 3 clinical trial involved 21,977 participants, showing a vaccine ef cacy of 91.6%.67 While most reported adverse events were grade 1, 45 of 16,427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 of 5435 partic- ipants in the placebo group had serious adverse events. None of these were considered to be associated with vaccination by the independent data monitoring committee. Four deaths were\nKantarcioglu et al.\nreported during the study period. Three participants (1 death is due to thoracic vertebral fracture, 2 deaths are due to COVID-19 infection) were in the vaccine group, 1 participant (due to hemorrhagic stroke) in the placebo group. None of the deaths are considered to be vaccine related. Russia approved Sputnik V in August 2020.\nGRAd-COV2 is a replication defective Simian Adenovirus (GRAd) vaccine candidate from Italy, that is derived from a gorilla, encoding full length profusion stabilized S protein for SARS-COV-2. It has a genome deleted of the entire E1 and E3 regions and the native E4 region replaced with the E4 orf6 of human Ad5 (hAd5).68 The clinical trial results have not its been published yet, but ReiThera Srl announced that vaccine candidate is well tolerated and induced a clear immune response in Phase 1 clinical trial. The Phase 2/3 clinical trials are ongoing for this vaccine candidate.69\nAZD2816 is a viral vector vaccine that is developed by AstraZeneca company in the UK. It is designed using the same adenoviral vector platform as AZD1222, with minor genetic alterations to the spike protein based on the Beta (B.1.351, South African) variant. The vaccine candidate is cur- rently being evaluated in Phase 2/3 clinical trials.70\nDelNS1-2019-nCoV-RBD-OPT1 is a non-replicative viral vector vaccine candidate from China, that uses in uenza virus as the vaccine platform. It is applied through an intranasal route. The NS1 gene segment of the virus is knocked out so that the virus can only multiply one round inside the cell at the upper airway and will not disseminate inside the body. In the empty space of the NS1 gene, the surface S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of COVID-19 applied which makes it a safe mucosal vaccine platform.71 73 The clinical trial results have not been published yet. The vaccine candidate is under investigation in Phase 2 clinical trials.74\nLV-SMENP-DC is developed by Shenzhen Geno Immune Medical Institute in China. It is made by modifying dendritic cells (DCs) with LV vectors expressing COVID-19 minigene (SMENP) and immune modulatory genes. The antigen-speci c cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) will be activated by LV-DC presenting COVID-19 speci c antigens. Currently, Phase 1/2 clinical trials are ongoing for this vaccine candidate.75\nHuman Adenovirus Type 5 vaccine candidate (hAd5 S+N bivalent vaccine) is a second-generation viral-vector vaccine that is developed by ImmunityBio, Inc in USA. It is targeting both S and N SARS-CoV-2 proteins to generate B and T cell memory to these antigens and, potentially, long-term immunity to the virus.76 The hAd5 vaccine platform was developed to in elicit Ad-immune individuals, meaning subjects can receive the vaccine multiple times. The stimulation of anti-hAd5 immune responses is attenuated with the second-generation platform in comparison with the  rst-generation platforms due to additional genetic deletions. Phase 1 studies of subcutaneous dosing in the US have demonstrated no serious adverse events and potent T-cell responses after a single prime dose. In addition, a single prime subcutaneous vaccination with this vaccine candi- date induced a 10-fold increase in T cell response equivalent\nanti-SARS-CoV-2\nimmune\nresponses\neven\nto T cell responses from patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. The Phase 1/2/3 trial is planned to study the ef - cacy, safety, and immunogenicity of this vaccine as a booster in participants who have already received a S-only antibody-based vaccine. Finally, hAd5 vaccine candidate has been developed in four formulations for different routes of administration: SC injection, intranasal spray, and a room-temperature-stable oral capsule that could potentially overcome the cold-chain distribution hurdles affecting many current COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.77\n(sublingual) SL drops,\nAdCLD-CoV19 is a replication-defective human adenovirus type 5/35 vector based vaccine developed by Cellid Co., Ltd in South Korea. The vaccine candidate is under investigation in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.78\nNDV-HXP-S (known as ButanVac in Brazil, COVIVAC in Vietnam, HXP-GPOVac in Thailand, Patrial in Mexico) is a NDV vector expressing membrane-anchored pre-fusion-stabilized trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2, with or without the adjuvant CpG 1018. CpG 1018 is a TLR 9 agonist adjuvant.79,80 Unlike the vaccines that are already in use, NDV-HXP-S can be produced using chicken eggs similar to  u vaccine production, making it simpler to manufacture, especially for middle-and-low-income countries. The vaccine candidate is under investigation in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.81\nMVA-SARS-2-ST is developed by the German Center for Infection Research in Hamburg, is a vector vaccine candidate based on MVA virus. The vector expresses a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The results of the Phase I clinical trial showed that the vaccines are safe and well tolerated  however, the immune responses were below expectations. For this reason, the Phase 2 trial planned for early 2021 was post- poned. With an optimized vaccine, the vaccine candidate is under evaluation in Phase 1 trial.82\nVXA-CoV2-1 is an oral COVID-19 vaccine that is developed by Vaxart company in USA. It is formulated as tablets that are enteric coated for ef cient delivery to the small bowel. The enteric coating protects the active ingredient from the stomach s acidic environment. While traditional injectable vaccines work by inducing a strong IgG response in the blood, oral vaccines induce an IgA response in the GI and respiratory tracts with some IgG responses in the blood as well. This is important in reducing viral shedding and preventing transmission. Vaxart s vaccine platform uses a non-replicating adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector the antigen. The antigen in VXA-CoV2 is composed of the genes coding for both the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the N protein. VXA-CoV2-1 is one of the  rst COVID-19 vaccine candidates that contains genes for both proteins. This is important because the mutations that occur in S protein may decrease the ef cacy of vaccines. The N protein is largely conserved between emerging strains of the SARS-CoV2 and may provide long-term immunity through vac- cinations. Vaxart also announced that they are working on a S-only vaccine which targets strains. VXA-CoV2-1 also uses a TLR-3 agonist, as an adjuvant that activates the innate immune system. The results of clinical\nthat delivers\nspeci cally variant\n9\n10\nstudies have not been published yet, but Vaxart announced that their vaccine candidate was safe and effective.83,84 The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials.85 MVA-SARS-2-S, is a vaccine candidate that uses a MVA virus as a vector. It is developed by the University of Munich in Germany. MVA is a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus originating from growth selection on chicken embryo tissue cultures, showing a characteristic replication defect in mammalian cells, and allows unimpaired production of heterol- ogous proteins. MVA is a weakened poxvirus approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of small- pox and monkeypox.86 The vaccine candidate is under investi- gation in Phase 1 clinical trials.87\nCOH04S1 (MVA-SARS-2-S) is based on a synthetic MVA (sMVA) platform. is developed by the City of Hope Medical Center in California. The vaccine candidate contains the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins inserted into the MVA plat- form. MVA can replicate DNA within cells, leading to the expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in order to trigger host immunity against the virus. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials.88\nIt\nBBV154 is an intranasal vaccine candidate that is developed by Bharat Biotech in India. It uses a non-replicating Ad5 vector platform to present S protein antigen to the immune system. Similar with other mucosal vaccines, it stimulates a broad immune response including neutralizing IgG, mucosal IgA, and T cell responses.89 Currently, the vaccine candidate is under investigation in Phase 1 clinical trials.90\nChimpanzee Adenovirus serotype 68 (ChAd) and self- amplifying mRNA (SAM); Gritstone Oncology is working on a different vaccine platform. In this platform, Chimpanzee Adenovirus serotype 68 (ChAd) and SAM vectors are used, which express additional SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. This vaccine candidate is under investigation in Phase 1 clinical trials.91\neither S alone or S plus\nSC-Ad6-1 is developed by Tetherex Pharmaceuticals Corporation in Oklahoma, USA. It is a novel single-cycle ade- novirus vector (SC-Ad) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The SC-Ad6-1 vector undergoes replication in the initial cells that it enters but lacks the genetic information to form infectious particles. Therefore, SC-Ad6-1 utilizes the potency of a rep- lication competent adenovirus vector but does not have the capacity to cause adenovirus infections in patients and/or personnel through the formation of infectious particles. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials.92\nCVXGA1-001 is developed by CyanVac LLC company in USA. It is a viral vector vaccine that uses Parain uenza Virus Type 5 (PIV5) as the vector which encodes the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. It is administered intra-nasally.

It is created by using AIVITA s autologous cell therapy platform. In this vaccine platform, autologous DCs are extracted and loaded with multiple recom- binant SARS-CoV-2 S antigens to create a vaccine that is spe- ci c to each individual. These cells are re-administered to the individual, with or without GM-CSF, to create fast immune pro- tection against the coronavirus. A kit containing all materials is provided to local sites, which can carry out steps with minimal equipment, to de-centralize manufacturing even in a third party GLP setting. The vaccine candidate is under investigation in Phase 1/2 clinical trials.98\nNucleic Acid Vaccines\nSimilar to viral vector vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines introduce genetic instructions (mRNA or DNA encoding the target antigen) to host cells for production of disease speci c antigens. Once these instructions have been taken by the host cell, the S protein antigen is produced by the host cell itself. The produc- tion of these antigens by the host cells effectively elicits both antibody production and T-cell induction, which are important parameters of vaccine protection. The mRNA vaccine technol- ogy consists of arti cial synthesis of the mRNA sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 that encodes the S protein. Incorporation of lipid nanoparticles (LNP) into mRNA vaccines protects them from enzymatic degradation and ensures ef cient cellular uptake. Following the cellular uptake, mRNA vaccines induce a prompt antigen expression, and the expressed antigens generate both humoral and cellular immune responses. When it is com- pared to other vaccine platforms, the production of mRNA vac- cines has less biosafety concerns, making them faster to produce. However, they require ultra-cold conditions for long- term storage.35 41\nDNA vaccines use plasmids for this purpose. They generally depend on cloning the SARS-CoV-2 S gene into bacterial plas- mids that contain a strong mammalian promoter, such as CMV and/or SV40, followed by large plasmid production in a compe- tent bacterium. The advantages of plasmid DNA vaccines are that they can target and stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses, they allow for  exible and simple large- scale production and formulation processes over short periods of time, and they offer  exibility for multivalency and room- temperature storage of the  nal vaccine.

Long-term risk of carcinogenesis is another concern for DNA vaccines due to integration of plasmid DNA to the host cell.35 41\nAs shown on Table 3, there are at least 29 nucleic acid COVID-19 vaccines or vaccine candidates that are registered in clinical trials.34 While two of these vaccines are approved for general or emergency use in several countries, the develop- mental processes of remaining vaccines are continuing in differ- ent stages of clinical trials.\nmRNA vaccines. BNT162b2 is a LNP formulated, nucleoside- modi ed messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, which encodes the RBD of the S1 protein. The RBD is constructed on a T4- britin derived fold on trimerization base, which helps to guide antigen folding into the native trimeric state. The N-methyl pseudo-uridine (m1 ) nucleoside modi cation pro- tects it from innate immunity. It is encapsulated with an LNP that protects it from enzymatic degradation and ensures ef cient cellular uptake.31 33 In the Phase 1 clinical trial, BNT162b2 elicited high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers with robust T cell responses. In addition, side effects were also acceptable, which were mainly composed of short-term local (ie, injection site) and systemic responses.99\nIn the Phase 3 clinical trial, a total of 43,448 participants were enrolled: 21,720 receiving BNT162b2 and 21,728 receiv- ing the placebo.100 A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 con- ferred 95% protection against COVID-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Local reactions were common and included pain, erythema and swelling at injection sites. Transient systemic reactions such as fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle and joint pain were also noted. The number of serious adverse events that were reported were similar, showing 126 (0.6%) serious adverse events reported in the vaccine group and 111(0.5%) serious adverse events in the placebo group. Only four serious adverse events (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration, right axillary lymphadenopathy, paroxysmal ventricular arrhyth- mia, and right leg paresthesia) can be related with BNT162b2. During follow-up, two BNT162b2 recipients (one from arterio- sclerosis, one from cardiac arrest), and four placebo recipients (two from unknown causes, one from hemorrhagic stroke, and one from myocardial infarction) have died. No deaths were con- sidered to be related to the vaccine or placebo.\nThe mRNA-1273 is another mRNA vaccine approved for use. It encodes the pre-fusion form of the S antigen that includes a transmembrane anchor and an intact S1 S2 cleavage site. Two proline substitutions in the vaccine mRNA keep the protein stable in its perfusion conformation. It is also encapsu- lated with an LNP. In the Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial, in safety and mRNA-1273 showed encouraging results immunogenicity.101\nIt\nis developed by Moderna Company in USA.\nIn the Phase 3 trials, 30,420 volunteers were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). The ef cacy has been symptomatic reported as 94.1% for\nthe prevention of\nClinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis\nSARS-CoV-2 infection and 100% for preventing severe COVID-19 as compared with placebo. Although transient local and systemic reactions were higher in the vaccine recipi- ents, the frequency of unsolicited adverse events, unsolicited severe adverse events, and serious adverse events reported during the study period were generally similar among partici- pants in the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the placebo group: (one from intra-abdominal perforation, one from cardio- pulmonary arrest, and one from severe systemic in ammatory syndrome in a participant with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse bullous rash) and two in the vaccine group (one from cardiopulmonary arrest and one by suicide).102\nThe mRNA-1273.351 is another mRNA vaccine that is devel- oped by Moderna company. is an LNP-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant.

Besides the S protein, SARS-CoV-2 has other structural pro- teins such as membrane (M), envelope (E) and N proteins. Antibodies that target M and E proteins have failed to neutralize the COVID-19 infection. For this reason, these 2 proteins are currently not considered as target antigen for COVID-19 vac- cines. On the other hand, N protein is highly immunogenic and induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses. To produce these recombinant protein vaccines, bacterial expression systems represent the most commonly used techni- que. These vaccines often require multiple doses and effective adjuvants to obtain a robust immune response. As live virus handling is not required, the subunit vaccine manufacturing process is safer and simpler, although manufacturing these vac- cines can be dif cult for mass vaccinations.35 41 To date, four subunit are available NVX-CoV2373, EpiVacCorona, Zi Vax and FINLAY-FR-2 vaccines.\nvaccines\nare\nfor\nuse.

CoVLP is a COVID-19 vaccine can- didate developed by Medicago company in Canada and GlaxoSmithKline company in the UK. The virus-like particles are produced by creating a bacterium engineered with genes of the virus, then introducing the bacteria into Nicotiana ben- thamiana plants. The plants take up the bacteria virus-derived generic material, producing in its leaves the virus-like particles, which are then harvested and extracted. The method of using a plant like N. benthamiana has been called  molecular farming  or a  plant-based factory , having vaccine manufacturing advantages of rapid, low-cost production of proteins, large scal- ability for production, and safety of using plants for pharmaceu- tical production.183 The vaccine candidate is currently under investigation in Phase 2/3 clinical trials.184\nRBD SARS-CoV-2 HBsAg VLP is a vaccine candidate that is developed by Serum Institute of India and SpyBiotech company in India.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several muta- tions have risen in the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2, leading to many new variants in different countries. In the analysis of an international database infections between February and May 2020, 5775 new variants have been reported.189 A consistent nomenclature has not been established for SARS-CoV-2 variants. Three mainly used nomenclature systems are GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian In uenza Database), Nextstrain Platform and PANGOLIN (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages) systems. Currently, eight global clades (S, O, L, V, G, GH, GR, and GV) have been identi ed in GISAID; thirteen major clades (19A, 19B, 20A 20J and 21A) have been identi-  ed in Nextstrain Platform and six major lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.177, B.1.1.7) have been identi ed in PANGOLIN system.190 193\ncovering the\nAn emerging variant that carries one or more of these muta- tions and becomes the responsible agent for the increasing pro- portion of the cases is considered as variant of interest (VOI). Further expansion of VOIs, causing public health risks at national or global levels, are considered as variants of concerns (VOCs).194,195 In fact, the surveillance of new SARS-CoV-2 variants is very important and is carried out by identi cation of new viral sequences. However, genome sequencing capabil- ities are limited in most parts of the world. More efforts are needed for the necessary surveillance of these variants in an international level of attention. As national authorities, institu- tions and researchers continue to monitor SARS-CoV-2 muta- the WHO has assigned simple, easy to say and tions, remember labels for key variants of SARS-CoV-2 using letters of the Greek alphabet in May 2021. According to these labels four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and four VOIs (Eta, Iota, Kappa and Lambda) have been designated for emerging variants (Table 5).\nA major focus of current research is whether any of these mutations have any potential to signi cantly alter important\nKantarcioglu et al.\nviral properties, such as the mode or rate of transmission, or the ability to cause disease. However, the observation that a new mutation is increasing in prevalence or geographic range is not suf cient to prove its selective advantage because such increases can also be generated by other causes such as non- compliance to the preventive measures.196 Variant mutations can occur in any part of the viral genome such as in structural protein genes or non-structural protein coding regions. The mutations that occur in the S protein genes, particularly the RBD coding regions are of the greatest importance because they are the main cause of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmission rates, increased disease severity-mortality rates and less susceptibility to monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies produced in response to infection or vaccination. These muta- tions can also negatively impact diagnostics or drug therapies that are used for COVID-19 disease.197 (Table 6)\nVaccine ef cacy is the reduction of the risk or odds of disease or infection among vaccinated persons. While new var- the ef cacy of iants continue to emerge, evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines in different settings and populations has become more dif cult.199,200 The necessity of additional vaccine doses for declining protection over time and decreased ef cacy for different variants of COVID-19 are unresolved issues for vaccine ef cacy. Real world vaccine ef cacy may differ from the results of randomized controlled trials because of the different target populations or different vaccine schedules that are applied in different countries. While many vaccine ef - cacy studies are continually published, the majority of these came from three countries with early introduction of vaccina- tion campaigns: Israel, the UK and the USA. Additionally, most of these reports on vaccine ef cacy were carried out on only two vaccines BNT162b2 (P zer) and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca). To improve vaccine ef cacy studies, WHO has produced best practice guidance on how to undertake vaccine ef cacy studies.201\nIn general, symptomatic disease ef cacy results of these studies, for fully vaccinated individuals, have been similar to the results of the randomized controlled studies of individual vaccines. Overall, vaccine ef cacy against severe disease, hos- pitalization and death is higher than ef cacy against non-severe disease, with the overall ef cacy of above 80% for AZD1222, mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and Coronavac vaccines. Although, the vaccine ef cacy against infection and asymptomatic infec- tion are slightly lower for AZD1222, mRNA-1273, and BNT162b2 vaccines, the vaccine ef cacy rates for these out- comes are almost uniformly >60%. Additionally, several the transmission to household studies have shown that members is reduced by approximately 50% when the infected household member was vaccinated with at least one dose as Importantly, vaccine ef cacy compared to unvaccinated. appears to be consistently higher for all outcomes after full vac- cination, de ned as at least 7-14 days after the  nal dose.198 (Table 7)\nThere is widespread concern that existing COVID-19 vac- cines may have reduced vaccine ef cacy against the four VOCs designated by WHO. Neutralization studies have\nshown that there is a several-fold reduction in neutralization of the VOCs, speci cally Beta, Gamma and Delta. However, a reduction in neutralization does not directly correlate with reduced vaccine ef cacy. This can be explained by several reasons: 1) there is currently no known threshold of neutraliza- tion below which vaccines no longer protect; 2) some vaccines produce higher neutralizing antibody concentrations so reduc- tions in neutralization will likely have a lesser effect on the ef - cacy for these vaccines; 3) and other factors besides neutralizing antibody levels, such as cellular immunity, may maintain pro- tection. More vaccine ef cacy studies of additional vaccines against the Delta variant and other VOCs are needed to better understand vaccine ef cacy against VOCs.198\nCOVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women\nAlthough, much progress has been achieved since the begin- ning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the issue of vaccinations in special populations remains unclear. One of these populations is pregnant or breastfeeding women. Vaccination during preg- nancy and lactation is common to prevent maternal and infant morbidity from other infectious diseases. Although live vacci- nations, such as measles, mumps, and rubella and varicella are contraindicated in pregnancy, in uenza and Tdap vaccina- tions are speci cally recommended to prevent infections during pregnancy.202 All currently approved COVID-19 vac- cines are not live virus vaccines.\nAccording to available information in the literature, pregnant women do not appear to get infected by COVID-19 more fre- quently than the general population and when they are infected, most experience mild to moderate disease.203,204 However, approximately 8  11% of pregnant women require hospital admission for COVID-19 related morbidity, and between 2% and 4% of pregnant women require intensive care unit admis- sion during the course of the disease.205 211 Risk factors for severe COVID-19 in pregnant women include race/ethnicity, older maternal age, pre-pregnancy obesity, asthma, cardiovas- cular disease, pre-gestational diabetes mellitus, chronic hyper- tension, chronic lung disease and healthcare personnel.212 214 Pregnant women with COVID-19 may also have an increased risk of preterm birth.215 218 The risk for preterm delivery has ranged from 10% to 25% in the literature with rates as high as 60% among women with critical illness. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has included pregnancy as a risk factor that can lead to increased risk for severe COVID-19.219\nIt is important to note that pregnant and lactating women were not included in COVID-19 vaccine trials.220 225 For this reason, the evidence for ef cacy and safety of COVID-19 vac- cinations during pregnancy and lactation is scarce, which makes the decision making more dif cult. In this regard, most of the information comes from animal studies and the inadvertent vac- cination of pregnant women during clinical trials or observa- tional studies. The safety and ef cacy of COVID-19 vaccines\n19\n20\nhave been tested in animal models, including mice, ferrets, sheep, and nonhuman primates. Developmental and reproduc- tive toxicology (DART) studies on the BNT162b2, mRNA 1273, AdsCoV2S, AZD122, Coronavac and BBIBP-CorV vac- cines have not shown any harmful effects in pregnancy.226 231 Inadvertent pregnancies in low number of recipients occurred in women having received a COVID-19 vaccine during BNT162b2, mRNA 1273, AdsCoV2S and AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine trials, revealing no difference in miscar- riage rates between COVID-19 vaccinated and placebo- vaccinated women.232 235 The results of observational studies have shown that vaccinations in pregnant and lactating women generated robust humoral immunity with immunoge- nicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non- pregnant women.236 Immune transfer of neutralizing antibodies from mother to neonates was observed via placenta and breast- milk in these studies.237,238 However, the vast majority of these studies were performed on mRNA vaccines and information on the effect of inactivated, viral vector and subunit vaccines on pregnancy or lactation is scant.239 242 Furthermore, although a causative relationship has not been fully established, a very rare syndrome, called vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocy- topenia (VITT) has been described and only seems to occur after adenovirus viral vector vaccines.243 However, similar kinds of viral vector vaccines have been given to pregnant women in previous Ebola and Zika virus vaccination programs without adverse pregnancy-related outcomes.244 246 Any inter- vention in pregnancy, including vaccinations, especially new ones, requires special careful attention to ensure safety of the pregnant women and their children. After several vaccines became available for use, a large amount of guidance was pub- lished by governmental public health agencies, drug regulatory\nTable 5.

With the  ow of new information, these guidance doc- uments have been substantially changed over time, between December 2020 until today.247 253 Overall further decisions on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy and lactation period should include a risk bene t analysis based on availabil- ity of the vaccine, the best available data and the exposure risk in the epidemiological background. It is important to highlight that the bene ts of vaccinations in pregnant or breastfeeding women far outweigh the risks.\nCOVID-19 Vaccination in Immunocompromised Patients It has been shown that patients with cancer are at signi cantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection. Additionally, when cancer patients are infected with COVID-19, they may have worse outcomes.254 258 This is caused partly by the disease itself and also by the immunosuppression caused by different treatment approaches such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and stem cell transplantation also make these patients more vul- nerable to COVID-19. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer patients have been classi ed as high-risk patients for severe disease, excluding them from early vaccine trials. Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) guidelines recommend vaccination with inactivated in uenza, Hepatitis B subunit and pneumococcus vaccinations in cancer patients.259 261 In general, live-attenuated vaccines are not usually recommended in primary or acquired immunode cient\nAdditional Mutations\nEarliest Documented Samples\nDate of Designation\n+S:484K\n+S:452R\n+S:L18F\nUnited Kingdom \nSep 2020\nSouth Africa May 2020\nDec 2020\nDec 2020\n+S:681H\nBrazil Nov 2020\nJan 2021\n+S:417N\nIndia Oct 2020\nVOI: 4-Apr-2021\nVOC: 11-May-2021\n+S:484K +S:484K\nMultiple countries   Dec 2020 Mar 2021 Mar 2021 United States of America\n+S:484Q\nNov-2020\nIndia,\nApr 2021\n+S:452Q\nOct-2020 Peru, Dec-2020\nJun 2021\nKantarcioglu et al.\nTable 6.

All currently approved pathogens present COVID-19 vaccines are not live virus vaccines.\nCytotoxic chemotherapies interfere with DNA replication, synthesis, and cell cycle progression. Lymphocytes are also sup- pressed by these therapies.262 However, this suppression is not complete and immune responses can be achieved by vaccina- tions, although, the patients are on cytotoxic chemotherapy.263  268 Titers can be helpful to assess the need for revaccination. Higher doses or boosters can be employed to enhance immuno- genicity. Overall, with the exception of intensive chemotherapy periods, patients undergoing chemotherapy are expected to gen- erate protective responses with COVID-19 vaccinations.\nTargeted therapies including the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib, sunitinib, imatinib and ibru- tinib and monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab, do not directly cause immunosuppression but they may have inhibitory effects on APC function, T cell activation and B cell signaling. However, cancer patients that are receiving these therapies can still produce enough immune response against vaccines.269 274 Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the patients being treated with targeted therapies will generate protective responses with COVID-19 vaccination.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors target immunological path- ways such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cyto- toxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) that are up-regulated in tumor-reactive T cells. Checkpoint inhibitors can cause immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), depending on the speci c therapy.275 There is a theoretical concern that vaccination could stimulate an over-reactive immune response and increase IRAEs in patients actively treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.276 However, larger studies with non- vaccinated comparison groups did not show higher frequencies of IRAEs with vaccinations.277,278\nPlasma-cell-depleting and lymph-depleting therapies, such as anti-CD20 and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies or\nCAR-T cells against CD19, reduce the number of peripheral B cells in patients. In practice, it is recommended that vaccines be given at least 6 months after anti-B cell therapy due to decreased ef ciency.279 286 However patients on anti-B cell therapy are at especially high risk for severe disease and death from COVID-19 can be an exception for this because vac- cines are the most powerful tools in prevention of COVID-19 infections.\nRadiation therapy is commonly used for patients with malig- nancies as a curative or palliative treatment option. It is known that radiation involving a large part of the body can have an impact on the bone marrow, however it is rare for radiation to have a signi cant impact on the immune system.287,288 Therefore, most patients treated with radiation can generate pro- tective immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines.\nCOVID-19 prognosis is poor in patients receiving hemato- poietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In HSCT recipients who develop COVID-19, the overall survival has been found to be 68% for recipients of allogeneic HSCT and 67% for recip- ients of autologous HSCT.289 In general, vaccines can be administered 4-6 months after HSCT. Live-attenuated vaccines are not recommended and should be administered at least 24 months after HSCT in patients who do not have graft versus host disease (GVHD) and take no immunosuppressive drugs in the last three months.290 Overall, most cancer\nimpair proper the immune immune response against vaccines. However, response may be weak in some cancer patients including those who are on intensive immunosuppression or HSCT. Many oncology professional scienti c societies including the the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) strongly recommend vaccinating patients with cancer.291 294 It seems that vaccina- tion in all cancer patients is safe, effective, and recommended,\ntreatments do not\n(SITC),\n21\n22\nClinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis\nTable 7.

It is important to complete the vaccination schedule and vaccination of house- hold members. All types of vaccines are safe and effective in these patients, except live-attenuated vaccines.\nDue to the immunosuppression that is needed for preventing graft rejection, the solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are susceptible including COVID-19.295,296 SOT recipients are also at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections and higher mortality rates compared to the general population.297 300 Furthermore, dueto theimmunosuppressed status,thesepatientsexperiencepro- longed SARS-CoV-2 shedding, which has been linked to the emergence of viral mutants.301 304 Although, prevention of COVID-19 infections is critical in SOT recipients, they were excluded from recent SARS- CoV-2 vaccine trials, so neither ef - cacy, and durability, nor safety are known in this patient sub- population. In SOT recipients the immune response to vaccina- tions produce lower antibody titers compared to the general popu- lations.305 307 Although there have been some concerns, vaccines have not been associated with graft rejection in SOT recipients.308 In general, live-attenuated virus vaccines are usually not rec- ommended in SOT recipients due to the risk of disseminated infection.309 The American Society of Transplantation (AST), the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation\nto\ndiverse\ninfectious\ndiseases\n(ISHLT) and the European Society for Organ Transplantation recommend that all solid organ transplant recipients should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, using locally approved vac- cines. All healthcare workers and household members who care for these patients should also be vaccinated against COVID-19 infection. Whenever possible, vaccinations are rec- ommended prior to transplantation (ideally with completion of vaccine series a minimum of 2 weeks prior to transplant). The best time for COVID-19 vaccine administration in the post- transplantation period is probably a minimum of three months after transplantation when immunosuppression is diminished, and other prophylactic medications are reduced. COVID-19 vaccination should be avoided in acute cellular rejection (ACR) status until ACR episodes are resolved, and high dose corticosteroid usage is not required anymore. Administration of an additional dose (third dose) of vaccine after completion of the vaccine series has been authorized by the EUA in the US as of August 12, 2021.310 312\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, in ammatory, demye- linating, and neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS), often leads to irreversible disability.313 The MS has become a concerning issue in the COVID-19 pan- demic. The use of lifelong disease modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS patients, cause immunosuppression and these patients become more susceptible to infections.314 316 Additionally,\nKantarcioglu et al.\neven with mild infections, exacerbations of the MS (relapses or progressions) can be observed. About 30 40% of MS patients experience post-upper respiratory infection relapse, although the mechanism is unknown.317 321 This kind of disease  ares have also been observed during the course of COVID-19 disease.322 The incidence of COVID-19 in people with MS ranges from below 1% to 11%. COVID-19-related MS mortal- ity has been reported to be approximately 1 4%.323 Several studies have shown that some DMTs are associated with increased risk of COVID-19. However, patients who are not receiving DMTs have also been shown as a high risk for COVID-19 infection in some studies.324,325 Moreover, discon- tinuing the routine therapeutic regimen for vaccination may cause progression and relapse, which needs to be taken into consideration. For against COVID-19 in MS patients are very important, because vaccina- tions can be an effective way to prevent COVID-19.326 328 It is important there is no proven relationship between vaccination and relapse or progression in MS patients.329 But MS patients may not display the adequate immune response because of the administration of DMTs. For this reason, patients who are on DMTs, a post-vaccination checkup may be necessary to make sure that the immunization has occurred properly. If an adequate response is not seen, a booster dose of vaccine may be administered.327 Patients teri unomide, natalizumab, glatiramer using  -interferons, acetate, or dimethyl fumarate probably have no issues regarding vaccine safety and ef cacy. The vaccine could be administered at any given time. In patients using  ngolimod, alemtuzumab, ocre- lizumab, rituximab, or oral cladribine, there is a possibility of insuf cient response to the vaccine. For instance, it was sug- gested to vaccinate patients starting B-cell-depleting therapies, 4 6 weeks before their  rst dose. If the patient has started therapy, the best vaccination time is 4 6 months after the last infusion. In the case of alemtuzumab, if the medicine has been used in the last 12 24 months, a reduction in the vaccine ef cacy may happen. Thus, it is recommended to postpone the treatment until vaccination iscompleted.In patients onimmunosuppressive treatments, such as mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, azathio- prine, and methotrexate, vaccination is probably safe, but proper immunization might not occur. For high dose corticoste- roid therapy, the best time of vaccine administration is 4 6 weeks following the last corticosteroid treatment to achieve optimal immunization. Vaccination is recommended in all MS patients without discontinuing their disease-modifying therapies, which could increase the risk of relapse and progression. Right timing is of great importance to maximize the ef cacy, especially in patients using high-dose corticosteroids and B cell-depleting therapies such as rituximab and ocrelizumab.330 333\nall\nof\nthese,\nvaccinations\nto highlight\nthat\nIn ammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a typical systemic immune mediated in ammatory disease that presents with chronic in ammation of the digestive tract, which is also associated with the development of extraintestinal manifestations. The impact of IBD on the risk of COVID-19 infection is controver- sial. Despite the above-mentioned information, there is no solid\nevidence indicating that IBD patients are at a higher risk of COVID- 19 infection.334,335 However, as with other immune- mediated in ammatory diseases, patients with IBD are treated with immunosuppressive drugs, such as high-dose corticoste- roids ( 20 mg prednisolone or equivalent), immunomodulators (thiopurines, methotrexate, and calcineurin inhibitors), anti- cytokine therapies (including anti-TNF and anti-IL-12p40 drugs), anti-integrin therapies (vedolizumab), and small- molecule inhibitors of signaling (tofacitinib), which can leave them susceptible to infections.336 Considering the importance of vaccinations in prevention of COVID- 19 infection, the safety and ef cacy of vaccines in IBD have been the subject of debate. Due to the exclusion of IBD patients from the phase 3 clinical trials for approved vaccines, the data regarding vaccinations is lacking for IBD. Based on previous experiences, it is possible to conclude that immunosuppressive treatments ef cacy. Live-attenuated can COVID-19 vaccines are not safe in patients receiving immune- modifying treatments or those going to receive such therapies in the next eight weeks. There is no relationship between vaccina- tion and the IBD disease onset,  ares, or exacerbation of IBD. The patients that are treated with glucocorticoids and biologic agents may have impaired immune response to COVID-19 vac- cines. Vaccinations against COVID-19 are strongly recom- mended in patients with IBD. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should not be deferred because a patient with IBD is receiving immune-modifying therapies. In patients with severe IBD  ares or those who need hospitalization, a delay in vaccination is pre- ferred. In patients receiving systemic corticosteroids, it is rec- ommended to vaccinate IBD patients when the dose of corticosteroids is at their lowest level.337,338\nimpair\nthe\nvaccination\nPatients with rheumatic diseases that are treated with cortico- steroids, immunomodulators and biologics are at an increased risk of infection during COVID-19 pandemic due to their immunocompromised status.339,340 Moreover, a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality might be possible due to the comorbidities present in rheumatic disease patients. Although, data regarding clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with an underlying rheumatic disease is very limited, the use of moderate to high doses of corticosteroids increased the chance of hospitalization. On the other hand, the use of TNF  inhibitors reduced the hospitalization rates. The use of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-in ammatory drugs), DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs), and JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitors did not change the rates of hospitalizations in COVID-19 infections.341 Similar with other special popula- tions, patients with rheumatic diseases were not included in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Only in BNT162b2 vaccine trial, 62 subjects (0.3%) with rheumatic disease included and received BNT162b2.98 Vaccination against COVID- 19 has been highly recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) in patients with rheumatic disease.342 344 Another important aspect is whether to continue or discon- tinue pharmacologic therapies in rheumatic disease patients\n23\n24\nwith respect to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. In this regard no modi cations have been recommended for hydroxy- chloroquine, sulfasalazine; le unomide, apremilast, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide (oral), intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), TNFi, IL-6R, IL-1R, IL-17, IL-12, IL-23, belimumab; oral calci- neurin inhibitors and glucocorticoids. Withholding of methotrex- ate for 1-2 weeks after single-dose COVID-19 vaccination have been recommended for a better outcome. JAK inhibitors have been recommended to withhold for 1 week after each vaccine dose. Abatacept have been recommended to withhold 1 week prior to and 1 week after the  rst COVID-19 vaccine dose. Administrationof abatacept can be scheduled sothatthe  rst vac- cination will occur 4 weeks after abatacept infusion and postpone the subsequent abatacept infusion by 1 week (a 5-week gap in total); no medication adjustments for the second vaccine dose. Administration of cyclophosphamide (IV) have been recom- mended to be scheduled  1 week after each vaccine dose, when feasible. For rituximab, vaccine series is recommended to initiate  4 weeks prior to next scheduled rituximab cycle; and delay rituximab 2 4 weeks after  nal vaccine dose. Due to considerable B cell suppression alternative treatments recom- mended if available.342 344\nCOVID-19 Vaccination in Children and Adolescents\nAs of 2020, the population under 20 years of age make up 33.3% of the world s population and 24.8% of the US population.345 Similar with other special populations children and adolescents, are excluded from vaccine trials. In children and adolescents the course of COVID-19 infections is mostly asymptomatic or mild. The case fatality rate of COVID-19 infection is signi cantly lower. Although it is rare, severe courses of COVID-19 infec- tions are also observed in children and adolescents.346,347 Severe COVID-19 infections can be prevented by vaccinations in high-risk children and adolescents.348 Additionally, vaccines may also prevent multisystem in ammatory syndrome in chil- dren, which is associated with COVID-19. The indirect bene t of vaccinations in children and adolescents is the formation of herd immunity. If only adults are vaccinated, COVID-19 out- breaks may continue in the population of unvaccinated children and adolescents. Because infections may spread from children and adolescents to the adults, restrictions on school and limita- tions on social activities of pediatric population may continue. Therefore, vaccinating children and adolescents may be neces- sary to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections. The results from phase 3 trials of multiple vaccines across dif- ferent vaccine platforms have con rmed that the vaccines are effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults. The mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 has shown 100% ef cacy and robust antibody responses in adolescents aged 12 15 years, leading to the FDA authorization for emergency use in adolescents 12 through 15 years of age.349,350 Coronavac was well tolerated and safe and induced humoral responses in children and adoles- cents aged 3 17 years.351 Other vaccine companies have also\nClinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis\nbeen started to assess the safety and ef cacy of various vaccines among the population aged 6 months to 17 years. It is important to note that, there are currently no data on the long-term effects of these new platform vaccines. Therefore, careful approach must be taken in the decision for vaccinating children and adoles- cents. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to obtain safety data prior to the decision of vaccinating children and adolescents.\nImportant Points Regarding COVID-19 Vaccinations\nBoth WHO and CDC recommend vaccination against COVID-19 in older adults.352,353 Adults 65 and older who received COVID-19 vaccines showed a reduced risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. COVID-19 vaccines in older adults reduce deaths, hospital visits, and number of cases. Vaccines are the safest and most powerful way to protect them from COVID-19 infection. Particular concerns should be counseled by respected scienti c authorities.354\nThe administration of a third booster dose is motivated after the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant throughout the world. COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in use seem to be more than 90% effective against hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Although, some studies have found that vaccine-induced antibody levels wane after several months, this is typical for all vaccines and not necessarily indicative of waning protection against the coronavirus. A few trials have tested booster doses. Third doses of vaccines mRNA1273, BNT162b2, AZD1222 AND Coronavac prompted a spike in levels of neutralizing antibodies, when administered several months after the second dose. What scientists do not know is whether these decrease in vaccine-induced antibody levels re ect a decline in protection against the virus. The drop in neu- tralizing antibody titers is not equal to waning cellular immunity. To look more closely for evidence of waning protection, analysis of health records may be a clue for evidence. In Israel, health records of more than 1.3 million people who were vaccinated between January and April 2021 analyzed, they found that the risk for infection was 53% higher for early vaccine recipients compared to those vaccinated later. At the end of July 2021, P zer BioNTech, published data on a preprint server showing that the vaccine ef cacy against symptomatic disease had dropped from 96% to 84% after 6 months. However, vaccine ef cacy against severe disease have remained high at 97%. While some countries like Germany and Israel have announced their plans for booster-shot programs, countries including the United Arab Emirates, China and Russia have started administering extra doses of vaccines. The WHO has called for a moratorium on COVID-19 boosters until the end of September 2021, with the aim of ensuring that at least 10% of people in all countries are vaccinated before extra doses are handed out. Because, 58% of people in high-income countries had received at least one vaccine dose; in low-income countries this number stood at just 1.3%. Global vaccine avail- ability is limited and will only become more limited if boosters\nKantarcioglu et al.\nare commonly used. However, If vaccines were not scarce, boosters would be less controversial. It is important to remem- ber that:  No one is safe until everyone is safe  which has become the mantra of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unmitigated transmission means rampant viral replication, which in turn means in nite opportunities for the emergence of new, more transmissible or vaccine-induced immunity. On the other side, Israel announced plans to give people aged over 60 a third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The United Kingdom has drawn up the plans to offer vaccines to those over 50, as well as other high-risk groups, from September 2021. The CDC released a joint statement saying that they have developed a plan to begin offering these booster shots this fall subject to FDA conducting an indepen- dent evaluation and determination of the safety and effective- ness of a third dose of available vaccines and CDC s (ACIP) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issuing booster dose recommendations based on a thorough review of the evidence.355 357\nvariants\nthat\ncould\nescape\nnatural\nimportant point about COVID-19 vaccines is mixing and matching approach in their administration. Currently, most of the current vaccination regimens include a second homologous booster dose following a priming dose with approximately a month interval. The idea of mixing vac- cines has come from the aim of increased protection, simplify- ing immunization efforts for countries facing insuf cient supplies of the vaccines. This concept is not something new but has been previously used for multiple illnesses including HIV, malaria, Ebola and in uenza.  Heterologous prime-boost vaccination  involves delivery of the same or similar antigens of the disease-causing agent through two different vaccine types with the  rst dosage being used to prime the immune system while the subsequent dosage using different vaccine types to boost the immune response. This aims to increase the protective ef cacy and rationalize the usage of the available vaccines. Mixing two different vaccines can also elicit a strong and long-lasting immune response as compared with the single vaccine regimen. This idea has been simulated in animal studies.358 One potential risk involved in vaccine mixing may include increased side effects. However, the clini- cal evidence for COVID-19 mixing is scarce and is limited to small number of studies. During the abrupt reactions to the AZD1222 vaccine, which left certain populations who had received their  rst dose of AZD1222 vaccine, but not the second dose, some countries urged these recipients to proceed with the second dose of AZD1222, while others, like Canada and several European countries, recommended a different vaccine for the second dose. However only a few of the poten- tial vaccine combinations have been tested in clinical trials.359  361 In these studies, researchers have found that following one dose of the AZD1222 vaccine with a dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine produces strong immune response, with an acceptable safety pro le.362 366 Several studies are now ongoing to test the combinations of BNT162b2, mRNA1273, AZD1222, NVX-CoV2373, Coronavac and Convidecia vaccines.367 373 (Table 8).\nAnother\nFuture Considerations\nSAR-CoV-2 and related variants will continue to emerge for years to come owing to the molecular adaptability and mutation during replication. Such variants will have a wide spectrum of pathogenic potential and will continually require optimized approaches to control their impact on public health. Until a long-lasting vaccine is developed, periodic vaccination and booster dosages will be required for specialized and compro- mised populations.\nCurrently, breakthrough infections with such variants as B.1.1.7 are occurring more frequently. Besides vaccination, other measures are recommended for the control of these mild infections. The vaccine supply has steadily increased to meet the demand and there is a need to provide vaccination globally. There is a need for more controlled vaccinations in countries where the vaccination rates are low, and the insurgence of new cases are high.\nThere is also growing concern regarding the vulnerability of the vaccinein the upcoming fall and winterseasons.Thismay resultin an increase of the positivity rate in not only the non-vaccinated population but also in the vaccinated groups due to breakthrough infection. Despite this, a large percentage of people may not want to get the vaccine due to the wrongful information regarding the adverse outcomes in vaccines. Although various initiatives have been taken at different levels to promote vaccination due to the ill- founded public reluctance, reaching vaccination coverage greater than 80% is doubtful. Initial approaches such as non-vaccine anti- viral drugs will soon be introduced, however, the effectiveness of such an approach is questionable.\nCurrently available vaccines confer time dependent immu- nity as evident by the breakthrough infections in some of the vaccinated individuals, however de nitive information on such breakthrough infection is not available at this time on spe- ci c vaccines. There is a need for multiple dosing vaccine to maintain a desired level of immunity against this virus.\nThe complete elimination of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be possible in countries with high vaccination rates and appropri- ate booster vaccine recommendations. However, such regional diminishment in COVID-19 cases will be hindered secondary to international travel and pathogenicity of variants. Thus, travel restrictions and other embargo approaches potential may require consideration.\nWhile the mortality rate of COVID-19 will be reduced with the use of vaccination, it will remain higher than what is observed with in uenza. Moreover, the emergence of new var- iants will continue to impact on current approaches to provide broad-spectrum immunity. The variants forms are unpredictable and advanced approaches on molecular modelling may provide leads to developing a broad-spectrum vaccine with longer lasting effects. This will require continued pre-clinical and clin- ical research.\nOf great concern is the potential emergence of other corona- virus pandemics with resistant viral pathologic pro les that their may require focused or control. It is unlikely that coronavirus mediated infection\nregional approaches for\n25\n26\nTable 8. Current Studies on COVID-19 Vaccine Combinations\nRef # Borobia et al.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the development and distribution of the vaccines have been on an accelerated schedule like we have never seen before. In an incredibly short period of time, vaccines that are quite effective have been developed and delivered to hundreds\n27\n28\nof millions of people throughout the world. Today, the future still holds some questions like the long-term effects of the vac- cines, how to vaccinate children or other currently unvaccinated populations, or other virus variants that may develop. However, it has been incredibly uplifting to see the efforts and collabora- tion of the many researchers, physicians, corporations, institu- tions, and governments across the globe slow down the spread of a global pandemic and offer hope to eradicate it someday soon.\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to acknowledge the support of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at Loyola University, Chicago, Health Science Division for the planning and completion of this manuscript.

Almalki,1,2 Maswood M. Ahmad,1 Imad Brema,1 Mohammed Almehthel,1,3 Khaled M AlDahmani,4,5 Moeber Mahzari,2,6 Salem A Beshyah7,8\nabstract: Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a common complication after pituitary surgery. However, it is most frequently transient. It is defined by the excretion of an abnormally large volume of dilute urine with increasing serum osmolality. The reported incidence of CDI after pituitary surgery ranges from 0 90%. Large tumour size, gross total resection and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak usually pose an increased risk of CDI as observed with craniopharyngioma and Rathke s cleft cysts. CDI can be associated with high morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognised and treated on time. It is also essential to rule out other causes of postoperative polyuria to avoid unnecessary pharmacotherapy and iatrogenic hyponatremia. Once the diagnosis of CDI is established, close monitoring is required to evaluate the response to treatment and to determine whether the CDI is transient or permanent. This review outlines the evaluation and management of patients with CDI following pituitary and suprasellar tumour surgery to help recognise the diagnosis, consider the differential diagnosis, initiate therapeutic interventions and guide monitoring and long-term management.\nKeywords: Central Diabetes Insipidus; Polydipsia; Polyuria; Pituitary Adenoma; Preoperative Risk Factor; Pituitary Surgery; Arginine Vasopressin; Desmopressin; Treatment.\nPituitary adenomas are the third most\ncommon intracranial neoplasm which accounts for 10 15% of all diagnosed intracranial tumours and are frequently treated with transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), except prolactinomas.1 Neurosurgical operations for pituitary and suprasellar tumours may result in postoperative complications due to the crucial anatomical location of these tumours. The resulting postoperative complications can manifest as anterior or posterior pituitary dysfunction, particularly sodium disturbances, due to the changes in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, which remains one of the most frequent postoperative reasons for hospital readmission.2 The patterns of water and electrolyte disorders after TSS can be divided into either polyuria or oliguria/hyponatremia, depending on the presence of either low or high levels of ADH, respectively.2 Some disturbances of water and electrolytes may not reach the level of clinically defined central diabetes insipidus (CDI) or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). However, they may still require acute or chronic management and are generally divided into six profiles of polyuria or hyponatremia as follows: transient or sustained polyuria, immediate or delayed hyponatremia and biphasic or triphasic diabetes insipidus (DI).2,3 CDI manifests as the excretion of large amounts of dilute urine that frequently occurs in the acute phase following surgery for pituitary adenomas,\nsubarachnoid haemorrhage or traumatic brain injury. Nonetheless, it occurs rarely in association with large pituitary adenomas before surgical interventions. Its occurrence in this setting should question this diagnosis and point towards other diagnoses such as craniopharyngioma or granulomatous diseases.4\nSerum sodium and osmolality levels are generally maintained within a very narrow range (within 1 2%) despite marked variations in water and salt intake and this is controlled by two mechanisms, namely arginine vasopressin (AVP) and thirst. The development of CDI after TSS for pituitary adenoma is common, but it is usually transient. Most patients who have free access to fluids and have intact thirst mechanisms can maintain normal serum sodium and normal fluid balance, as well as avoid dehydration and hypernatremia that usually result from the development of a significant water deficit. Hence, it is exceptionally vital to freq- uently monitor the urine output, serum sodium and daily fluid balance in all neurosurgical patients following TSS. When patients have impaired levels of consciousness due to various factors, such as sedation, or if the thirst mechanism is impaired, for example in the rare subtype of adipsic DI, they can develop significant water deficit and severe hypernatremia.5,6\nThe measurement of copeptin as a surrogate marker for AVP in the diagnostic workup of the three main causes of polyuria (i.e. CDI, nephrogenic\n1Obesity, Endocrine and Metabolism Centre, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 2Faculty of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdul Aziz University of Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 3Division of Endocrinology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; 4Division of Endocrinology, Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates; 5Department of Medicine, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates; 6Department of Medicine, Ministry of National Guard Health Affair, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 7Department of Medicine, Dubai Medical College, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; 8Department of Endocrinology, Mediclinic Airport Road, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\n*Corresponding Author s e-mail: m2malki@yahoo.com\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nDI and primary polydipsia) has revolutionised the management approach of the patients with these suspected conditions, given its stable assays, high diagnostic accuracy and high specificity.7 10 Due to a paucity of studies comparing different treatment and monitoring strategies for acute CDI following transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, there is a general lack of clear guidelines based on grades of evidence for acute DI following TSS management. Nonetheless, there have been increasing adverse events, including death, which have been highlighted in recent years for the patients with established CDI, mainly due to a lack of knowledge among health professionals dealing with this condition.11 Hence, there is a need to update the knowledge highlighting all the pitfalls that can lead to adverse patient outcomes.\nThe rationale for this review article is to present updated information regarding the frequency, predictors of occurrence, clinical presentation and diagnostic workup, including the role of measurement of copeptin, which fills an important gap that exists regarding the limitation of water deprivation test in differentiating between CDI and primary polydipsia. The therapeutic interventions for CDI will also be reviewed, including those used for treating the rare and serious subtype of adipsic DI, as well as the prognosis of CDI following TSS.\npredictors\nEarly detection of CDI can be meaningful to patient care and outcomes following pituitary surgery. DI after pituitary surgery is reported to be associated with 3.9-fold increase in patients  mortality.21 Therefore, risk factors for CDI following pituitary surgery have been explored in several studies. The factors that may predict both transient and permanent DI include larger craniopharyngioma, Rathke s cleft cysts, tumour size, low postoperative copeptin levels and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Other factors that have been shown to predict only TDI include ACTH-producing adenoma, visual abnormalities on presentation, suprasellar tumour extension, gross total resection, postoperative CSF leak and first postoperative serum sodium of >145 mmol/L. In contrast, predictors of PDI only include younger age and reoperation, the former likely due to large tumour mass, while the latter due to possible injury to the neurohypophysis and/ or stalk traction.2,8,22 25 After the transcranial pituitary surgery, the degree of deformation of the third ventricle and hypothalamus as assessed by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and postoperative haemorrhage was associated with both transient and permanent DI.17\nepidemiology\nPresentation and Diagnosis\nCDI is a significant complication following pituitary surgery which has been reported in the medical literature. Transient diabetes insipidus (TDI) has been reported in 1.6 45.6% of the patients after pituitary surgery with a transnasal microsurgical approach and in 2.5 26% of those who had surgery with the transnasal endoscopic approach.6,21 Permanent diabetes insipidus (PDI) is less common and has been reported in 0 10% of patients following the microsurgical approach and in 0 12.5% of patients following the endoscopic approach.12,13 The evidence is inconsistent regarding whether endoscopic TSS is associated with a lower incidence of DI in comparison to microscopic TSS, with some studies showing a lower incidence while others do not.13 15 One study investigated the DI following transcranial pituitary surgery and found the incidence of TDI and PDI to be 21.1% and 12.2%, respectively.16 CDI is more common after craniopharyngioma surgery and has been reported in up to 90% of the patients.17 Additionally, DI occurs in the acute phase of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in approximately 3% and 26% of cases and 15% of cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).18,19 CDI in the vast majority of cases of TBI and SAH is transient. Persistent CDI in the setting of TBI and SAH is usually a late manifestation of severely raised intracranial pressure and, in this context, has a considerably grave prognosis.18 20\nclinical presentation\nCDI should be considered when a patient excretes large volumes of diluted urine after surgery, typically ranging in 3.5 16.8 L per day, in the presence of high or normal serum sodium and osmolality.26 The onset of polyuria is usually abrupt and occurs within the first 12 24 hours after surgery.27 However, later presentation (two weeks to three months after surgery) has been reported in patients with Rathke s cleft cyst.28 The pathophysiology of this is not well understood but it has been suggested to be resulting from the release of cyst contents, causing inflammation to the infundibulum.29\nPolyuria is the hallmark of CDI. However, not all patients with polyuria after pituitary surgery have CDI, as polyuria could result from the reactive postoperative diuresis in patients who received excess amounts of intravenous fluids during surgery. It is also essential to rule out other common causes of polyuria such as hyperglycaemia and diuretics use before labelling a patient with CDI. The classic triphasic water dysregulation is rare and occurs in approximately 1.1 3.4% of postoperative patients where transient DI, a polyuric phase occurring due to the abrupt cessation of AVP release as a result of the temporary hypothalamic dysfunction, is followed by the second\nReview | 355\nphase that resembles SIADH, which is caused by the sudden release of AVP from the degenerating pituitary. Finally, depletion of AVP stores leads to permanent CDI.30,31 The onset of polyuria is usually abrupt and occurs within the first 12 24 hours after surgery. The initial transient phase of DI happens within 1 3 days after surgery and typically lasts for 5 7 days. The second phase ensues 7 8 days postoperatively and can last 2 14 days if there is no recovery of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-secreting neurons. The third phase occurs when DI reappears as a result of depletion of ADH stores.32 35\nPatients with DI typically complain of persistent excessive thirst and drink to compensate for the water loss to maintain serum sodium within the normal range. However, patients with limited access to water, impaired consciousness level or impaired thirst sensation may rapidly develop signs of dehydration on physical examination in addition to hypernatremia (serum sodium >145 mmol/L) if free water loss is not replaced.36,37\ndiagnostic workup\nThe diagnosis of CDI postoperatively begins with the risk assessment using pre- and intra-operative predictive factors before the patient is transferred\nfrom the operation room. Excessive thirst and polyuria are the clinical features that typically trigger an evaluation for CDI.38 Hence, careful documentation of hourly fluid intake and urine output is essential for the early identification of CDI. It is crucial to note that polyuria may not always be due to DI; as seen in cases of mobilisation of intraoperative fluids and hyperglycaemia, it can also be due to a sharp drop of growth hormone level post acromegaly surgery and the use of certain medications such as furosemide or SGLT2 inhibitors.39 Therefore, documentation of hypotonic polyuria is essential in establishing the diagnosis of DI. Seckel and Dunger criteria to diagnose CDI rely on the presence of hypotonic polyuria (urine osmolality <300 mOsmol/kg and urine output more than 2 mL/kg/h) in addition to increased serum osmolality (>300 mOsmol/kg) after excluding other causes of polyuria, such as glucosuria.40 In adult patients in particular, urine output of more than 250 mL per hour for two consecutive hours when supplemented with the presence of normal or high serum sodium, normal or high serum osmolality with a urine osmolality of less than 300 mOsmol/ kg is highly suggestive of DI.41 Urine specific gravity is easily assessed at the bedside and could provide a\nFigure 1: Post-pituitary-surgery evaluation (risk-based assessment).

First, there is a lack of universal diagnostic criteria for DI and enormous variability in the monitoring of patients following pituitary surgery. Moreover, the current diagnostic criteria may not apply to patients who are able to consume water and self-manage CDI, especially if the DI is partial. Furthermore, thin adults could have DI, but their urine output is <200 mL/h, which may delay the diagnosis. For such patients, using weight- based criteria to define polyuria (urine output of >2 mL/kg/h or >50 mL/kg/day) would be more accurate. Additionally, the frequency of monitoring electrolytes is highly variable among physicians.43 Therefore, frequent assessment of electrolytes and osmolality in patients with a decreased level of consciousness or impaired thirst sensation is necessary for early detection of CDI.\nParameter\nDescription\nFluid balance\nVariable, usually negative (more output than input)\nUrine output\nAt least >2 mL/kg/h for two consecutive hours in addition to other parameters\nSerum osmolality\nNormal, if the patient has free access to water, or high, >300 mOsmol/kg, if the patient has limited access to water\nSerum sodium\nNormal, if the patient has free access to water, or high, >145 mmol/L, if the patient has limited access to water\nUrine osmolality\nPersistently <300 mOsmol/L\nUrine specific gravity\nPersistently <1.005\nCopeptin\n<2.5 pmol/L\nTable 2: General management strategies for a patient with diabetes insipidus\nImmediate postoperative period\nThe difficulty in diagnosing CDI, particularly in the immediate postoperative period, has led to the exploration of other ways to diagnose CDI.44 Plasma AVP measurement has been explored; however, it could be challenging as its half-life is short (16 minutes) and the AVP is usually unstable in collected plasma samples and is affected by many factors leading to its inaccurate level.45 47 Moreover, AVP measurement with ELISA is not usually feasible due to the small size of AVP.48 Furthermore, AVP measurement, usually done by rapid acting insulin and requires a relatively large sample volume, is not available in a timely manner to diagnose DI as it requires a relatively long time and specialised labs to process it. For these reasons, AVP measurement is rarely useful in the diagnosis of postoperative DI.\nAssessment of volume and hydration status; measurement of serum sodium\nClose monitoring of serum sodium and urine output\nOptimisation of fluid replacement\nConsideration of desmopressin therapy in a patient with excessive and inappropriately dilute urine output\nTitration of desmopressin dose to keep 24-hour urine output above the normal range (15 30 mL/kg/day)\nAfter hospital discharge\nLimiting fluid intake to the amounts required to satisfy thirst\nPerforming electrolyte panel checks in any unwell patient after hospital discharge; close postoperative follow-up\nMonitoring for water intoxication and hyponatremia\nOn the other hand, copeptin is the C-terminal peptide of pro-vasopressin, co-secreted with AVP in an iso-osmolar manner, and reflects AVP level accurately. Unlike AVP, copeptin measurement is less cumbersome as it remains stable in collected plasma samples for days and its measurement is associated with less preanalytical errors.49,50 It is highly accurate in identifying the aetiology of polyuria in the non- acute setting.51 However, its utility in the post- pituitary-surgery setting has been evaluated in only a few studies. A multicentre study, 50 out of 205 patients who developed CDI revealed that a copeptin level of <2.5 pmol/L is accurate in establishing the diagnosis of CDI with a specificity of 97% and positive predictive value of 81% when measured within 24 hours of surgery.52 In contrast, a value of >30 pmol/L almost excluded the diagnosis with a negative predictive value\nDelaying a dose of desmopressin once or twice per week to allow an aquaresis to occur\nRegular counselling of patient and their family about the principle of the treatment regime\nTable 3: Management of hypodipsia/adipsia with central diabetes insipidus\nSet a target (kg) at the weight the patient is known to be euvolemic and normonatremic\nFix 24-hour urine output at 1.5 2 L\nDetermine the obligate fluid intake (approximately 1.5 L)\nMeasure weight daily\nDaily water intake = obligate volume + (target weight   daily weight)\nCheck plasma sodium weekly\nEducate patients and their family about the principle of the treatment regime\nReview | 357\n(NPV) of 95%. The performance of the test was better when performed <12 hours after surgery with lower accuracy beyond 24 hours. Similarly, the test proved superior in predicting persistent rather than transient DI (68% versus 32%). Another study of eight out of 58 patients with CDI with a standardised copeptin testing time showed that a peak copeptin level of <12.8 pmol/l at 60 minutes post-extubation predicted CDI, while permanent CDI was excluded with 100% NPV in those with a level of >4.2 pmol/L.53 Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the copeptin level between the two groups in the subsequent post-extubation assessments at 6 48 hours.\nmultifaceted and can be divided into acute or chronic phases, depending on the stage of the disease, to restore osmotic equilibrium. Although specific guidelines related to the management of postoperative DI are unavailable, in the recent past, a disease state review, followed by guidelines on hypopituitarism, was published, offering some guidance to the clinical management.42,58 The general strategies of management of CDI are presented in Table 2. The acute phase management covers the first two phases of the triphasic water dysregulation phenomenon.\nCopeptin is a promising marker that will likely be a routine diagnostic test in the evaluation of CDI in the future. However, presently, the limited number of studies about copeptin use, the uncertainty about the optimal time of its measurement after surgery and the limited availability of the assay are factors limiting its widespread use. Table 1 summarises the various parameters that are frequently needed to be evaluated in post-pituitary-surgery patients and the expected changes in these parameters in patients with postoperative DI. A risk-based algorithm is proposed on the frequency of laboratory investigation to identify DI in the postoperative period [Figure 1].\ntreatment\nAlthough ADH secretion the disturbance of fluid balance often begin during the intraoperative period, CDI usually presents within a few hours after surgery. It is imperative to rule out intraoperative fluid overload and glycosuria as potential causes of polyuria. It is also noteworthy that patients with acromegaly may experience increased urinary output following the resection of their pituitary mass due to diuresis of excess fluid within the soft tissues.54,55 Furthermore, approximately 50% and 80% of patients with transient DI recover within seven and 90 days of surgery, respectively.56 As such, patients are advised to monitor for the cessation of thirst sensation and resolution of polyuria as potential signs of DI recovery. Moreover, periodic monitoring of electrolytes can be useful to confirm DI recovery, as water deprivation tests are not routinely recommended in this situation.57 An additional advice is to delay desmopressin (DDAVP) dose for a few hours to see if increased thirst and polyuria persist.57\nimpairment and\nPatients require continuous monitoring of fluid intake and urine output and frequent assessment of electrolyte. DDAVP should be used cautiously as required, especially during the first two weeks postoperatively to avoid hyponatremia due to over- replacement.31 Treatment of postoperative CDI is\nAcute Management of Central Diabetes Insipidus\nfree water access\nThe management is straightforward, provided there is an intact thirst mechanism, i.e. the patient is not receiving fluids for any reason and can drink water at will. Water balance can be achieved under such a situation as long as the patient can consume enough fluids.59,60 Patients with a decreased level of consciousness and impaired thirst mechanisms or those on intravenous (IV) fluids will require continuous adjustment of IV fluids and pharmacotherapy to maintain adequate hydration and sodium equilibrium. The appearance of hypernatremia and polyuria along with dehydration heralds the onset of CDI. It should be aggressively sought out during the immediate postoperative period as hypernatremia can cause brain shrinkage, leading to vascular rupture and intracranial bleeding, along with other complications.61\nThe serum sodium level can be normalised safely at a correction rate of 1 mEq/L/h without any untoward complications.62,63 Hypotonic fluids should be used when intravenous fluids are mandated. The least amount of fluid possible should be used and rapid overcorrection must be avoided as it can lead to cerebral edema.63\nvasopressin\nVasopressin is available as an aqueous solution. Due to its short half-life of around 20 minutes, it should be administered through IV infusion when acute control of antidiuresis is needed.64 Infusion is usually started at a rate of 0.25 1.0 micro unit/kg/h and titrated every half hour after that to maintain the urine output rate at around 100 mL/h and/or urine specific gravity at around 1.010 1.020.\ndesmopressin\nDDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, having a prolonged\n358 | SQU Medical Journal, August 2021, Volume 21, Issue 3\naction profile with minimal vasopressor activity. It can be administered orally, intranasally, subcutaneously or intravenously.65 Studies have shown a definite relationship between the magnitude and duration of its therapeutic effect and its IV dosage. In patients with CDI, 1  g IV  push  infusion can increase urine osmolality to a maximum of 700 800 mOsmol/ kg.66,67 Further increase in dose, from 1 to 8  g led to prolongation of the duration of action from around 26 hours to 46 hours. The magnitude and duration of its therapeutic effects showed large interindividual variability attributed to individual differences in renal concentration abilities, as it persisted even when the dose was increased to more than 2  g.67 70\nMinimising the risk of hyponatremia due to excessive water retention is another critical challenge as it can be occasionally symptomatic and, rarely, life- threatening. Excessive fluid consumption suppresses vasopressin secretion in normal subjects by non- osmotic mechanisms, leading to diuresis and thus preventing over-hydration.74,75 This  escape  mechanism is not possible in patients with CDI as they are on exogenous long-acting desmopressin. Consequently, dilutional hyponatremia occurs. A longer-acting form of antidiuretic therapy and limiting fluid intake to the amounts required to satisfy thirst are the possible ways to achieve this goal. Titration of antidiuretic dose to keep 24 hours urine output within the normal range (15 30 mL/kg/day) is equally important.76\nFurther studies have shown that the antidiuretic efficacy depends on the total dose as well as the rate of increase in plasma DDAVP level.71 The human kidney loses concentrating capacity in the absence of vasopressin. Therefore, once treatment is initiated, it requires at least eight hours of continued therapy for full recovery.72 According to several studies, the parenteral DDAVP can be administered safely to acutely ill patients with CDI. However, the needed dose depends on the individual response, intactness of thirst mechanism and other factors determining fluid intake. In patients with intact thirst mechanisms, a starting dose of 0.25 0.50  g twice daily as an IV infusion over two hours is usually administered, which is adjusted further to normalise urine output and maintain sodium equilibrium. A smaller dose of 0.06 0.125  g is usually preferred with further titration to the desired effects for patients who are unable to drink at will or are on IV fluids. Although hyponatremia can be a manifestation of excessive DDAVP administration, the second phase of the triphasic water dysregulation phenomenon also presents with hyponatremia. Both of these have the same underlying mechanism and management principles that require withholding DDAVP along with careful electrolyte and fluid balance monitoring.\nchronic management of central diabetes insipidus\nSince CDI rarely remits once established, it requires continuous, complete and around-the-clock manage- ment of the polyuria and maintenance of sodium and water equilibrium. Hypernatremia rarely goes unnoticed as it is always associated with polyuria and dehydration. Management principles of hypernatremia are same as mentioned above; however, in case the duration of hypernatremia cannot be ascertained, the serum sodium level should be corrected at a rate of 0.5 mEq/ L/h, with no more than an 8 10 mEq/L decrease over 24 hours, while keeping the target sodium level at 145 mEq/L.61,63,73\ndesmopressin   nasal spray\nIntranasal DDAVP has an absorption ratio of around 10 20% when compared to IV preparation in patients with CDI.77 Moreover, it has interindividual and in the magnitude and intraindividual variability duration of its antidiuretic effect. The variability is irrespective of age, severity of polyuria or body- weight,78,79 leading to the duration of action ranging from 4 18 hours to 8 24 hours seen with 5 10 and 20  g, respectively.69,80,81 The intranasal preparation is useful as it allows individualisation of treatment and dose titration by metered-dose spray (2.5 10  g per spray). One must note that the absorption of nasal DDAVP may be decreased in the setting of nasal inflammation and rhinorrhoea, such as in upper respiratory tract infections, and therefore patients may need to use extra doses or shift to other routes if polyuria and dehydration are present.\ndesmopressin oral tablets\nDue to their large molecular size and susceptibility to enzymatic degradation coupled with short plasma half- life, vasopressin and DDAVP were initially considered to be unsuitable for oral use. However, despite low oral bioavailability of around 16%,82 a stable antidiuretic effect with a clear dose response relationship has been observed in clinical trials,83 and preparation strengths (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg) are available for oral use. DDAVP oral doses required for equivalent antidiuretic efficacy are around 10 20 times of the intranasal doses; however, the ease of administration makes oral formulations the preferred route of treatment for most patients. Although individualisation of therapy and titration of the dose is needed, 0.1 0.2 mg every eight hours is the usual maintenance dose,80 while less frequent dosing, such as once or twice daily, is generally sufficient for infants and children.84\nReview | 359\ndesmopressin oral formulations   oral melt\nSince 2005, DDAVP has been available as a sublingual lyophilizate (Melt) formulation containing 60, 120 and 240  g, having bioavailability of around 25%.85 In a recent study, DDAVP Melt has shown a similar level of antidiuretic control and was found to be as efficacious as intranasal DDAVP in both children and adults.86\nCDI once established rarely remits. The treatment of CDI in the elderly does not differ much from that in young adults, though the former faces a higher risk of developing hyponatremia, primarily when intranasal DDAVP is used.78 The aetiology is not clear at present. Abnormalities of osmoregulation of thirst and fluid intake, along with increased renal sensitivity to DDAVP, may be the possible explanation as this population is known to be affected by these factors.94\nCentral Diabetes Insipidus in Specific Populations\nhypodipsia/adipsia with central diabetes insipidus\nneonatal infants/children\nThe treatment of CDI in this group requires consideration of their diets which contain a proportionally larger amount of water. Therefore, to prevent hyponatremia, urine volume must not be reduced too much and careful dose titration with close input/output and plasma sodium monitoring are required. Continuous intravenous infusion of low dose DDAVP (0.1 0.2  g s.c./i.m) or arginine ADH (0.25 3 mU/kg/h) under intensive monitoring is often used in the first 24 48 hours postoperatively.87,88 Once CDI is stable and permanent, regular DDAVP can be prescribed. A diluted rhinyl preparation of nasal spray in the amount containing 1 5  g of DDAVP once or twice daily usually provides good control of CDI in infants.89 DDAVP can be administered subcutaneously in doses ranging from 0.02 to 0.08  g once or twice daily.90 Children and their parents need to be educated about the features of water intoxication and the hazards of excessive fluid intake.\nAnterior hypothalamus injury leading to osmoreceptor damage culminates in the absence or deficiency of thirst and results in the rare occurrence of adipsic DI. As a result, these patients have neither of the homeostatic mechanisms required for water balance regulation. Consequently, their management becomes difficult and they suffer from wide fluctuation in serum sodium levels.95 In addition, during acute illnesses, patients can develop life-threatening hypernatremia, resulting in somnolence, seizures, hemiplegia, coma and acute renal failure and can experience thrombotic episodes. Furthermore, other complications such as obesity and sleep apnoea, which is largely attributed to hypothalamic abnormalities, may be seen in assoc- iation with adipsic DI; these conditions contribute to the excess morbidity and mortality found in a patient with adipsic DI.96 It becomes necessary to prescribe fluid intake on a sliding scale based on daily weight and serum sodium level.97 DDAVP, alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, is a useful agent in this regard.\npregnancy and lactation\nDDAVP, being resistant to placental leucine amino- peptidase, can be administered safely to pregnant women, both for gestational DI as well as to patients with pre-existing CDI who become pregnant.91,92 Compared to non-pregnant women, the doses needed are usually the same or slightly higher. Placental leucine aminopeptidase usually disappears in 4 6 postpartum weeks when DDAVP can be discontinued in patients with gestational DI. It should be kept in mind during the monitoring of therapeutic effects that serum sodium level during pregnancy decreases typically by approximately 5 mmol/L compared to the nongravid state. As DDAVP appears in an infinitesimal amount in breast milk, it can be continued during lactation.93\nAn alternative and more practical approach is to set a target weight (kg) at which the patient is known to be euvolemic and normonatremic and maintain fixed urine output at 1.5 2 L with a fixed amount of DDAVP. Furthermore, daily fluid intake can be titrated as obligate load (1.5 L in temperate climates) + (target weight   daily weight) to maintain volume status, sodium and osmolality within the defined range.98 Successful treatment can be achieved through daily measurement of body weight and perhaps weekly serum sodium measurement along with careful monitoring and patient and family education.98 Additionally, due to the high rates of venous thrombosis and thrombo- embolism in patients with adipsic DI, giving low- molecular-weight heparin during periods of hyper- natremia dehydration is recommended. Furthermore, screening for sleep abnormalities is indicated.99 The principles of management of adipsic DI are displayed in Table 3.\nelderly\nAs mentioned above, CDI requires lifelong manage- ment and, even if the underlying cause is eliminated,\n360 | SQU Medical Journal, August 2021, Volume 21, Issue 3\nConclusion\nCDI is a frequent complication that occurs in patients who undergo surgery for pituitary and suprasellar tumours and is the commonest leading cause for hospital readmission of these patients. Therefore, clinicians dealing with these patients need to perform a thorough preoperative risk assessment in order to identify known predictive factors for CDI, such as in patients with craniopharyngioma and with larger tumours, in order to have clear strategies in place for early diagnosis and management. Moreover, postoperative evaluation should be performed in the early and late postoperative periods in order to reduce the risk of complications and unnecessary readmissions to the hospital. While the management of CDI which complicates surgery for pituitary and suprasellar tumours is a commonly encountered topic, it nonetheless remains a challenging area for clinicians and requires high standards of medical knowledge in tandem with superior clinical experience and skills, especially regarding the decision about when to start desmopressin therapy and for how long, as well as planning the long-term follow-up for those who develop permanent CDI.\n5.\nSmith D, McKenna K, Moore K, Tormey W, Finucane J, Phillips J, et al.

Current therapies have mechanisms of action involving signalling via one of four pathways: endothelin-1, nitric oxide, prostacyclin and bone morphogenetic protein/activin signalling. Efficacy has generally been greater with therapeutic combinations and with parenteral therapy compared with monotherapy or nonparenteral therapies, and maximal medical therapy is now four-drug therapy. Lung transplantation remains an option for selected patients with an inadequate response to therapies.\nThis article has an editorial commentary: https://doi.org/10.1183/ 13993003.01222-2024\nReceived: 9 July 2024 Accepted: 9 July 2024\nIntroduction Medications approved to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) lead to improvement in functional class, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, function and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/ N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) levels, among others [1 3]. These benefits have been seen in clinical trials across a wide range of PAH severities and across multiple PAH subgroups.\nright heart\nCompared with monotherapy, larger improvements are seen with combination therapy and thus most patients with PAH are candidates for oral or oral plus parenteral combination therapy from the time of diagnosis, along with early reassessment and escalation in therapy when indicated (figure 1).\nTrials utilising a time-to-clinical-worsening composite as a primary or secondary end-point have demonstrated that PAH therapies also improve longer-term outcomes. Results have been driven most strongly by reductions in PAH clinical worsening and in PAH-related hospitalisations, but in meta-analyses a modest reduction in all-cause mortality has also been reported [4]. Indeed, survival from the time of diagnosis appears to be improving in observational studies as well, although the median survival time remains <10 years [5, 6]. There remains a need for improved utilisation of existing therapies, particularly parenteral prostacyclin pathway agents (PPAs), as well as the targeting of novel therapeutic pathways.\nThe addition of sotatercept, an activin signalling inhibitor, to the treatment armamentarium has brought significant optimism, as it is the first treatment to act on a completely novel pathway in nearly two decades [7, 8], and four-pathway drug combination therapy is now an option (figure 2). Longer-term studies are still underway and will be important in providing a better understanding of the overall benefits and safety profile of this medication.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\nEur Respir J 2024; 64: 2401325\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M.

Patients achieving a lower-risk status based on these measures have better outcomes than patients who fail to do so [37], and PAH treatment guidelines have traditionally utilised these severity measures as a means for choosing PAH therapies, with a goal of achieving a low-risk status.\nWhile this approach has made sense based on both the order in which PAH therapies were discovered as well as the inclusion criteria and trial design for most early studies where only patients of certain functional classes were included, achieving a low-risk status in the short-term has not been found to be a strong surrogate for longer-term clinical worsening outcomes [38].\nIt empirically and through randomised studies to identify optimal treatment strategies.\nis therefore likely that alternative strategies will be needed in the future, optimally determined\nWhat future treatment algorithms may look like remains to be seen: will early or upfront initiation of three or even four medications be shown to be beneficial, leading to a strategy similar to guideline directed medical therapy in heart failure [39]?

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) stimulators increase signalling in the nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) pathway, resulting in increased cGMP levels, and prostacyclin (PGI2) and other prostacyclin pathway agents (PPAs) bind the prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor), promoting the production of cAMP, leading to vasodilation and inhibiting vascular cell growth. Sotatercept, a novel biologic agent targeting the transforming growth factor-  superfamily, acts as a ligand trap for activins and related growth factors. This helps rebalance growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signalling pathways, with multiple downstream effects. Signalling is shown as proceeding from endothelial cell to smooth muscle cell for simplicity, but is bidirectional.

Indeed, initial triple oral therapy was found not to be superior in the TRITON study, which evaluated combination therapy with tadalafil, macitentan, and selexipag versus tadalafil, macitentan and placebo [9]. Continued use of a predominantly risk-based treatment approach is therefore recommended, but with the anticipation that this will likely change as additional studies are completed.\nDetails on risk stratification can be found in the WSPH task force article on PAH risk stratification and treatment goals [40]. In general, recommendations are for initial treatment based on stratification as high versus not high risk, while beginning at first follow-up a  four-tier  approach is recommended, stratifying patients into low risk, intermediate-high and high risk based on risk calculators. The most commonly utilised include those developed from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL registry), including REVEAL 2.0 and REVEAL lite 2.0 [41], and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) calculator, studied with slight variations across multiple cohorts [42 46]. Noninvasive prognostic measures included in all the commonly used risk calculators include functional class, 6MWD and BNP or NT-proBNP levels. Patients with good results on all three measures have excellent 1-year outcomes and these results can be utilised as a core component in decisions regarding PAH medical therapies. However, optimal risk reassessment for making treatment decisions requires other measures including serial cardiac imaging and haemodynamics, particularly when considering major treatment changes. These measures are important in order to more fully characterise overall disease status and because factors including age, comorbidities, musculoskeletal disease and other the noninvasive results.\nintermediate-low,\nfactors beyond PAH severity can also affect\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n3\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M.

Although no major new supportive care recommendations are made when compared to the most recent WSPH and ESC/ ERS PAH guidelines [47, 48], attention to these measures remains important. In particular, female patients of childbearing potential should be offered highly effective birth control, and recommendations against pregnancy for most patients are maintained, due to unacceptably high maternal risk in PAH; see also pregnancy recommendations in the WSPH article on PAH management in special conditions [54]. As general healthcare measures, all PAH patients should receive vaccinations, with particular attention to respiratory pathogens including influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [47], and vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus should be recommended\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n4\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M.

Data from randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) on anticoagulation in PAH are lacking and available data derived from observational studies and registries have demonstrated conflicting results regarding efficacy in idiopathic (IPAH), hereditary (HPAH) or drug- or toxin-induced (DT)-PAH [55 58]. Therefore, anticoagulation is not generally recommended but may be considered on an individual basis [47]. In contrast, registry data have more consistently suggested an absence of benefit and probable harm with anticoagulation in CTD-PAH,\nTABLE 3 Recommended supportive measures [47 49]\nSupervised exercise training Psychological support Immunisation against SARS-CoV-2, influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae and consider vaccination against RSV Diuretic treatment in patients with fluid retention Continuous LTOT when arterial blood oxygen pressure is consistently <8 kPa (60 mmHg) Correction of iron status in patients with iron-deficiency anaemia Advise against pregnancy Clear contraceptive advice Pre-transplant counselling\nSARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus; LTOT: long-term oxygen therapy.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n5\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\nand its routine use is not recommended [47]. Finally, pre-transplant counselling on issues such as weight optimisation, avoidance of tobacco and illicit drugs, and attention to treatment of comorbidities is recommended, in order to ensure potential future barriers to transplant are addressed [59].\nVasoreactivity and calcium channel blockers It is recommended that patients with IPAH, HPAH or DT-PAH undergo acute vasoreactivity testing during the index right heart catheterisation in order to identify patients who should be treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Acute vasoreactivity is defined by a decrease of the mPAP by  10 mmHg to reach an absolute mPAP <40 mmHg, without a decrease in cardiac output [47]. A recent multicentre study evaluating acute vasoresponders has found that patients meeting these haemodynamic criteria plus having a large improvement in pulmonary arterial compliance were more likely to have a long-term response, but we do not recommend a change in the acute vasoresponder criteria at this time. Significant heterogeneity in long-term response was also found in this study, emphasising the need for early comprehensive risk-reassessment at 3  4 months [60]. CCBs should be initiated at a low doses followed by uptitration based on overall response including haemodynamic measures; to achieve an optimal response, high doses may be required. Treatment goals include a low-risk profile on noninvasive testing and near normalisation in haemodynamics. Former CCB responders should be managed as per the standard (nonvasodilator) PAH algorithm; whether to discontinue CCBs is not well studied.\nPatients with PAH and mPAP 21 24 mmHg and/or PVR <3 Wood Units The 6th WSPH recommended lowering the mPAP threshold for the diagnosis of PH from  25 mmHg to the ESC/ERS guidelines recommended lowering the threshold for >20 mmHg [61]. Subsequently, abnormal from >3 Wood Units (WU) to >2 WU [47]. Taken together, these modifications to the haemodynamic definition of pulmonary hypertension (PH) will change the expected incidence and prevalence of PH, although the magnitude of this change has not been well characterised to date [62]. Importantly, while the new definition of PH identifies a larger cohort of patients with pulmonary vascular disease, current therapies for PAH were studied in populations fulfilling the old definition. As such, there are no approved therapies for patients with mPAP between 21 and 24 mmHg. There are few current studies examining the impact of vasodilator therapy in patients with mildly elevated pressures (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04797286); most of the completed studies included patients with scleroderma and exercise PH and thus lack generalisability to PH patients with mildly elevated pressures [63 65]. A consensus is therefore lacking on whether patients with mildly elevated pulmonary arterial pressures and PVR should be considered for initiation of PAH therapies. Clinical trial enrolment is recommended, if available, and all patients should be closely monitored for progression. If a decision to initiate therapy is made despite a lack of robust trial data, initial monotherapy is recommended over combination therapy.\nTreatment algorithm: initial treatment, patient selection and choice of therapy The majority of patients included in PAH clinical trials have had IPAH, HPAH, DT-PAH or connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated PAH, and therefore the treatment algorithm presented is focused on these patients. This algorithm is also intended for patients with phenotypically clear-cut PAH, similar to the majority of patients enrolled in PAH clinical trials, and for patients with a mPAP  25 mmHg and PVR >3 WU; see also the section on comorbidities and phenotypes herein and in the WSPH article on definition, classification and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension [66].\nInitial therapy following diagnosis should be based on an evaluation of risk status. For patients not classified as being at high risk at baseline, initial therapy with an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist (ERA) and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) combination is recommended [47]. Same-day initiation of both medications is well tolerated and is a recommended option, but sequential initiation over a short period of time (1 2 weeks) to assess tolerability is also acceptable. Use of tadalafil in combination with macitentan or ambrisentan is preferred, based on stronger evidence of efficacy for these combinations [9, 10, 21] versus combinations containing bosentan or sildenafil [67]. When using sildenafil, initiation with 20 mg orally three times daily is recommended, but uptitration to 80 mg can be considered if needed, though at a cost of a higher rate of adverse events [17, 18].\nPatients with severe PAH and classified as high risk at the time of diagnosis should receive a parenteral therapies (intravenous PPA in combination with an ERA and a PDE-5i epoprostenol, subcutaneous or i.v. treprostinil) were initially evaluated as monotherapy [35, 36, 68], well-conducted observational studies have suggested significantly improved outcomes, including survival, for initial includes a parenteral PPA in high-risk patients [5, 69]. A discussion about lung transplant and potential referral should also be considered at diagnosis in high-risk patients, depending on patient, centre- and region-specific criteria; see also the WSPH article on\n[47]. Although parenteral\ntriple combination therapy that\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n6\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\ntransplantation and bridging and support technologies in pulmonary hypertension [70]. Patients classified as non-high risk, but having some high-risk features may also be considered for initial parenteral therapy, based on observational data showing excellent and possibly superior long-term outcomes in some subgroups of patients with this approach [5].\nInitial triple oral therapy with selexipag, a PDE-5i and an ERA is not recommended based on the TRITON trial, which found no difference in PVR or other end-points at 26 weeks [9, 71]. Finally, while inhaled therapies (inhaled treprostinil, inhaled iloprost) and oral riociguat may be considered as a component of initial therapies, the overall evidence for this based on patient number, duration and types of studies is lower compared with initial ERA PDE-5i combination therapy [21, 23].\nInitial reassessment for potential therapy escalation: early is preferred The optimal timing of the first follow-up reassessment and potential treatment escalation has not been fully established, but 3 4 months appears to be a reasonable compromise allowing most prognostic measures to have reached or neared a plateau [72]. There is some evidence that patients receiving add-on therapy earlier following their diagnosis may have a more robust response versus those much later in the disease process, although this is more speculative [73]. The 3 4-month time point for reassessment applies only to patients who are stable or improving during this time; those with clear-cut deterioration should be considered for treatment escalation promptly. For patients initially receiving monotherapy, the addition of a second agent at this time (or earlier) should be considered for most patients, including in particular patients who have not reached a low-risk status.\nLow risk at follow-up: is additional therapy indicated? Most patients currently classified as low risk still have significant symptoms and reduced exercise capacity. the AMBITION, GRIPHON and Risk of progression is also present; SERAPHIN trials, >20% of patients classified as low risk on multiparameter risk scores developed a clinical worsening event within 3 years of study entry [38]. These results suggest that simply achieving a low-risk status based on current risk calculators alone is insufficient to ensure optimal symptom control or an adequate long-term clinical response in all patients.\nin a combined analysis of\nHowever, clinical trials have also found smaller short-term improvements in functional class and 6MWD in PAH patients with low-risk scores [74]. And while the relative risk reduction in clinical worsening in PAH RCTs appears similar in magnitude in lower-risk versus higher-risk patients, the absolute risk reduction in lower-risk patients is small [75]. Additional PAH therapy may also lead to additional side-effects and expense.\nIndividualised management may therefore be considered. Expanded goals of therapy have been proposed, including a PVR <5 WU [76], large declines in the PVR (e.g. >50 60%) [77 79], improvement in stroke volume index or other haemodynamic measures [80] and achieving a normal or near-normal right heart size and function on cardiac imaging [81]. However, longer-term studies are needed in order to better determine the extent to which these measures add value on top of an already low risk status.\nIntermediate-low risk at follow-up: treatment escalation Patients already on combination oral therapy who are at intermediate-low risk on a four-tiered risk scale should be considered for add-on or transitions in therapy, including add-on therapy with sotatercept, with an oral PPA (selexipag, oral treprostinil), with an inhaled PPA, or with transition from an oral PDE-5 inhibitor to riociguat. Table 4 summarises key trials performed with these medications among patients already on one or more therapies. Studies of both sotatercept and selexipag included large numbers of patients on combination background therapy, providing a higher level of evidence for their use in this setting, while studies of oral and inhaled treprostinil included only patients on monotherapy.\nDifferences in route of administration, types of background therapy, trial designs and safety profiles for these medications make comparisons difficult, with the impressive and more robust improvement with sotatercept countered by larger and longer clinical trials focused on the prevention of clinical worsening for the oral PPAs.\nSpecifically, in STELLAR (n=323), patients receiving sotatercept showed a placebo-corrected improvement in 6MWD of 41 m (p<0.001, primary end-point) at 24 weeks, along with improvement versus placebo in health-related quality of life, functional class, haemodynamics, echocardiography and NT-proBNP [82]. In addition, patients in the sotatercept arm had significantly fewer clinical worsening events over a median follow-up of 33 weeks (hazard ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.08 0.35) [8].

All patients were on background PAH therapy including 4% on one, 35% on two and 61% on three approved background PAH therapies. Additionally, 40% were receiving a parenteral PPA.\nBy contrast, studies targeting the prostacyclin pathway with oral agents, GRIPHON (selexipag) and FREEDOM-EV (oral longer-term studies (median follow-up >1 year) with event-driven composite primary end-points. Both studies showed a significant reduction in worsening events, with a 40% (p<0.001) reduction in GRIPHON and 26% (p=0.03) reduction in FREEDOM-EV [11, 28]. Change in 6MWD was more modest, with an improvement of 12 m (p=0.003) in GRIPHON and 8 m (p=0.12) in FREEDOM-EV (both placebo-corrected).

For trials, adverse events leading to sotatercept discontinuation were uncommon (2% in STELLAR), but a number of adverse events including serious adverse events have been associated with sotatercept use. Bleeding events occurred in 22% of the sotatercept arm and 13% of the control arm in STELLAR, usually as minor mucosal bleeding (nosebleeds, gingival bleeding), but serious events have also been reported across the sotatercept studies including gastrointestinal bleeding, central nervous system bleeding and haemoptysis. Other adverse events of potential importance included the development or worsening of telangiectasias, increases in haemoglobin and decreases in platelets. In contrast, the most common PPA-associated adverse events seen in these studies were those common to all prostacyclins and include headache, flushing, jaw pain, extremity pain, nausea and diarrhoea. These PPA associated adverse events tend to occur early on after medication initiation and may improve over time or with dose reduction.\nthe sotatercept\nOverall, these differences make it difficult to make any strong recommendations. In general, one might consider sotatercept in those with greater symptom burden or greater impairment in exercise capacity, given the improvement in these measures seen in STELLAR. In contrast, one might consider selexipag or oral treprostinil as a simpler approach initially in those at higher bleeding risk, such as with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, or when aiming for a reduction in long-term clinical worsening events and/or in those who are more comfortable with the more established long-term safety profile.\nInhaled PPA (inhaled treprostinil or iloprost) [33, 34, 83] are also options as add-on therapy for patients at intermediate-low risk. However, as a less convenient option due to route of delivery and the number of\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n8\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\ntreatments required per day (four for treprostinil, between six and nine for iloprost), and as medications these studied either as monotherapy (iloprost) or added-on to monotherapy (inhaled treprostinil), medications are most often considered when issues with tolerability arise with other medications, or in patients felt to be at higher risk of adverse events with oral medications. Positives include a lower frequency of prostacyclin-type side effects versus other routes, and potentially fewer systemic effects in general [84].\nSwitching from a PDE-5i to riociguat may also be considered, based on a positive randomised but unblinded study evaluating the likelihood of clinical improvement in patients previously treated with a PDE-5i who were randomised to either switch to riociguat versus continuing a PDE-5i [15, 85]. Clinical improvement was defined as absence of clinical worsening and improvement in at least two of three of the following: 6MWD, World Health Organization functional class and NT-proBNP. Although the study was positive, the lack of blinding as well as the use of an unvalidated outcome measure lowers the strength of this recommendation.\nIntermediate-high and high risk at follow-up: maximal therapy and transplant Patients at intermediate-high risk at follow-up should receive a parenteral PPA or be considered for add-on sotatercept, while those at highest risk should receive a parenteral PPA, if not already receiving. Parenteral PPA have been studied as monotherapy [35, 36, 68], double combination [19] and triple combination therapy (observational), including in patients with functional class IV symptoms and other signs of severe disease [5, 79]. Maximal medical therapy is now four-drug therapy; this is based on the sotatercept RCTs where a majority of patients studied were receiving background triple therapy [7, 8].\nTiming of referral, evaluation and listing for transplant will depend on many factors including potential barriers to transplant that may need to be addressed, local criteria for listing, local waitlist and prioritisation factors. Patients should be considered for referral for lung transplant evaluation with any of the following: progressive disease or hospitalisation for PAH despite therapy, need for parenteral PPA, known or suspected pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD)/pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis (PCH) or the development of secondary liver or kidney dysfunction. Transplant evaluation is generally considered in high-risk patients at diagnosis, and is recommended in all follow-up patients with progression to or persistence of intermediate-high- or high-risk features [86]. Additional criteria which may also be considered for referral and listing are discussed in the WSPH article on transplantation and bridging and support technologies in PH [70].\nAmong those listed for transplant, further prioritisation (ranking on the priority list) can be difficult in PAH as traditional measures utilised for transplant prioritisation have not performed very well in PAH in this setting, and PAH patients have higher rates of waitlist mortality compared with patients with parenchymal lung disease [87, 88]. Alternative strategies, such as moving acutely decompensated PAH patients who are failing to improve with initial intensive care treatments to the top of the waitlist, may reduce mortality [89]. Appeal for a higher lung allocation score may also be an option in regions where this strategy is available [87].\nComorbidities and other patient populations at higher risk of adverse response to medications Given the large variability in pathophysiology and phenotypes for patients with PH and comorbidities, a separate  comorbidities  arm has not been included in the PAH treatment algorithm. Instead, a very careful approach to these patients is recommended, as detailed later, in order to identify patients who have definite/phenotypically clear-cut PAH and may benefit from PAH therapies, including potentially upfront combination therapy as per the treatment algorithm, as well as others who are unlikely to benefit and may be harmed by PAH therapies.\nPAH patients with comorbidities are increasingly seen in clinical practice and have been found in several studies to have a higher rate of adverse events with therapy [90] and possibly a less robust treatment response. Potential contributors include differences in PAH phenotype as well as the occurrence of occult group 2 PH, where patients meet typical haemodynamic criteria for pre-capillary PH at rest, but manifest group 2 haemodynamics with provocative manoeuvres such as exercise or fluid challenge, resulting in misclassification.\nClinical, haemodynamic and imaging findings may raise concern for occult group 2 PH. This includes catheterisation findings of a relatively higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (12 15 mmHg range) and relatively lower PVR (3 5 WU), echocardiographic findings of left atrial enlargement, grade 2 or\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n9\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\nhigher diastolic dysfunction, a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or left-sided valve dysfunction, and including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, sleep medical conditions associated with left heart disease, apnoea, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease [91].\nWhile many patients with these features will have group 2 PH and should not receive PAH therapies at all, a subset of patients may have PAH, but with a high comorbidity burden. In this setting, initiating therapy as monotherapy may be preferred in order to monitor for tolerability and response to therapy. Although head-to-head data are lacking, the rate of adverse events and medication discontinuation rate may be higher for the ERAs versus the PDE-5i in this setting, so starting therapy with a PDE-5i may be preferred [92].\nAnother subset of patients present with more clear-cut group 1 PAH, despite having one or more comorbidities. This patient population is increasing in clinical trials, mirroring the prevalence of comorbidities in the general population. For example, in GRIPHON, 51% of all patients had at least one cardiovascular comorbidity, including hypertension (33%), obesity (27%), diabetes (11%), and coronary artery disease (10%), while in AMBITION, 40% had hypertension, 10% diabetes and 4% coronary artery disease [90]. Subgroup analyses can be difficult to interpret, but reductions in risk of clinical worsening in the  comorbidities  patients in these two studies were generally similar to the overall results [90, 93].\nThese findings demonstrate the potential benefits of PAH therapy in patients with comorbidities, including the use of combination therapy in some patients with comorbidities who meet the rigorous inclusion criteria typical of PAH clinical trials. However, caution is warranted, as treatment-associated adverse events were more common and improvement in symptoms and walk distance end-points were more modest [90, 93].\nAnother common setting where concern for a non-group 1 diagnosis may occur is with significant pre-capillary PH in combination with lung disease. PAH clinical trials have typically excluded those with moderate or severe lung disease, but not mild lung disease. Subgroup analyses focused on lung function and/or oxygen use from PAH clinical trials are lacking. Registry data suggests that patients with both a smoking history and a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide <45% may have a less robust times after PAH therapy (and other unique improvement phenotypic findings), but clinical trial outcomes focused on this subgroup are needed [94]. Criteria for approaching the diagnosis and treatment of group 3 PH as well as details on differentiating group 1 PAH versus group 3 PH are discussed separately in the WSPH article on PH associated with lung diseases [95].\nin 6MWD and shorter average survival\nWhen PAH therapies are started in PAH patients with comorbidities, close follow-up is needed due to higher adverse event rates. There is also the potential for an alternative and sometimes non-group 1 PH diagnosis to be revealed only following therapy initiation. In this setting, PAH therapies should generally be discontinued and treatment focused on the underlying condition.\nIn all the settings described, evaluation at an expert centre is recommended. While PAH therapies may be of benefit to a subset of patients with these more complicated phenotypes, harm or possible harm with PAH therapies has been seen across a wide range of pulmonary and cardiac conditions, including ERAs and riociguat in interstitial lung disease, ERAs in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), PDE-5i in group 2 PH with a history of left-sided valve disease or HFPEF and PDE-5i in PH associated with sickle cell anaemia [92, 96 105]. Management recommendations are described in the WSPH article on PH associated with left heart disease [106].\nPAH subgroups CTD-PAH Patients with CTD-PAH comprise the second-largest PAH subgroup included in clinical trials of PAH therapy, after IPAH, accounting for 30 40% of the study population [107, 108]. The majority of these patients have scleroderma-related PAH (SSc-PAH). Despite a lower disease prevalence in the general population than other CTDs such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, PAH is more commonly seen in SSc, with 8 12% of patients developing this disease [109, 110]. Outcomes for patients with CTD-PAH vary, with the worst outcomes noted for SSc-PAH compared to other CTDs [111]. In general, survival in SSc-PAH is worse than IPAH, but has improved over the past decade, with median survival approaching 8 years in SSc-PAH [112]. Similarly, relative improvements in other outcomes, such as time to clinical worsening and 6MWD, have been observed, although the magnitude tends to be smaller than that seen in IPAH populations [107]. Reasons for these differences may include limitations of the outcome measures for CTD-PAH patients where comorbidities contribute to time to clinical worsening and functional limitations and lower thresholds for clinically relevant changes as seen in the 6MWD [113]. Furthermore, pulmonary venular involvement leading to a PVOD phenotype may be under-recognised in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n10\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\nSSc-PAH and is associated with poor response to vasodilators and poorer outcomes overall [114, 115]. Despite these potential modifiers of response to therapy, post hoc analysis of the AMBITION study demonstrates similarly robust improvements in time to clinical worsening and 6MWD with initial PDE-5i and ERA therapy in CTD-PAH patients as IPAH patients [116]. As such, previous consensus recommendations have supported application of the same general treatment algorithm for CTD-PAH as other forms of PAH.\nOne caveat to this treatment approach based on risk assessment is the limitation of risk assessment tools in CTD-PAH and specifically SSc-PAH populations, where model performance may not be as robust as in IPAH [117]. Given the differences in treatment response and outcomes in CTD-PAH compared to other forms of PAH, CTD-specific tools may be needed to better assess risk in this population, along with close attention to haemodynamics and right ventricular imaging.\nIn addition to differences in treatment response, CTD-PAH patients have a higher incidence of treatment- related adverse events compared to other PAH types, which may limit use of certain therapies in this population [107]. Caution should be exercised with initiation of medications that may increase bleeding risk, such as sotatercept, in CTD patients who are predisposed to gastrointestinal bleeding due to vascular anomalies. In addition, digital contractures and impaired manual dexterity may impact the ability of some CTD-PAH patients to manage parenteral therapies, further limiting treatment options.\nCongenital heart disease associated PAH with unrepaired defects Congenital heart disease (CHD)-associated PAH includes four subtypes: Eisenmenger syndrome, PAH associated with persistent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, PAH with small/coincidental defects and PAH associated with repaired defects. Many clinical trials of PAH therapies included CHD patients with repaired defects as long as >1 year since the time of repair, and these patients are typically treated similarly to those with IPAH.\nIn contrast, patients in the first two groups, having significant and unrepaired congenital heart defects, have more complicated pathophysiology and have been excluded from most PAH clinical trials. A comprehensive evaluation including assessment therapeutic strategy, complication monitoring and psychological important, and should be performed by support multidisciplinary team in an experienced centre. Post-capillary PH must also be excluded prior to considering PAH therapies. Supportive therapies include assessment for iron deficiency, avoidance of routine phlebotomy, use of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of endocarditis (for cyanotic CHD or with prosthetic material), and the use of air-filters with i.v. lines [118].\nfor potential closure, medical\nis\nCompared with other group 1 PAH subgroups, particularly IPAH and CTD-associated PAH, clinical trial data on PAH therapies in patients with unrepaired CHD-PAH are limited. In the BREATHE-5 trial, greater functional and haemodynamic improvement was seen with bosentan versus placebo [119], while in the MAESTRO trial, macitentan failed to improve 6MWD versus placebo, but led to lower NT-proBNP (overall only PAH-treatment-na ve patients, while 27% of patients in MAESTRO were on a background PDE-5i. Improvement in exercise capacity, symptoms and survival in CHD-PAH has also been suggested with PAH therapies more generally, including double and triple combination therapy [120 127], but these data are largely observational. Larger and higher-quality studies in CHD-PAH are needed.\nstudy)\nand\nimproved\nhaemodynamics\n(substudy)\n[14]. BREATHE-5\nincluded\nInitiation of PAH therapies in a sequential and symptom-oriented fashion is generally recommended (initial monotherapy, add-on therapy as needed) in both Eisenmenger syndrome and in PAH associated with persistent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, especially in those patients with preserved exercise capacity. However, greater haemodynamic improvement has been reported with use of combination therapy, and in recent years the use of combination therapy has become more common [127, 128]. For patients with persistent high-risk clinical features, lung or heart lung transplantation should be considered [129, 130].\nFor patients in whom closure is not initially considered feasible, a number of reports have suggested that closure might be considered after treatment with targeted drug therapy for PAH, if sufficient improvement is seen [131]. However, there is still no evidence for a long-term benefit from this approach, and caution is warranted. Decisions on shunt closure should not be made on haemodynamic parameters alone, and a multiparametric strategy should be followed. There is a need for future prospective studies, ideally with randomisation, to ascertain the benefit and safety of this approach; see also the WSPH article on paediatric PH [132].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n11\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\nDrug- and toxin-associated PAH A number of medications are associated with the development of PAH, covered in greater detail in the WSPH article on the definition, classification and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension [66]. Outcomes appear to be heterogeneous. Partial or full reversal of PAH has been reported after discontinuation of some agents, including dasatinib [133] and interferon [134], and thus for patients exposed to these medications and presenting with lower-risk features, discontinuation of the causative medication followed by close observation can be considered. If no improvement is seen over a period of 3 4 months, PAH therapy should be started. Some medications, particularly chemotherapy agents, have also been associated with PVOD/PCH, and this should be considered in the appropriate setting [135]. For stimulant-associated PAH, the most common form of drug/toxin-associated PAH in the current era, spontaneous remission is not typical, and patients with DT-PAH associated with stimulants also appear to have worse outcomes versus IPAH [136, 137]. Treatment recommendations include initiation of PAH therapy following the treatment algorithm (figure 1) and referral for treatment of substance use at the time of diagnosis.\nHIV-PAH Patients with PAH associated with HIV tend to be younger and are more likely to be male and to have more severe haemodynamic abnormalities versus patients with IPAH/HPAH [138, 139]. HIV itself is a risk factor for the development of PAH, although high rates of stimulant use and intravenous drug use, both risks for PAH, are also seen [86]. Treatment response to PAH therapies appears similar versus IPAH, based on open-label clinical studies [140] and observational data [138, 139, 141], and small numbers of HIV-PAH patients have been included in many of the large PAH RCTs [9, 21, 23, 24, 28]. Treatment with both highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and PAH therapies is therefore recommended. This does require extra attention to potential medication interactions, particularly when protease inhibitors are being utilised as a component of HAART. Drug levels of both sildenafil and tadalafil, in particular, are increased significantly in this setting, and the manufacturers of both PDE-5i recommend against their use in PAH with any strong cytochrome P450 3A inhibitors. However, given the fatal nature of untreated/inadequately treated PAH, coadministration of protease inhibitors and reduced-dose PDE-5i has been described in the literature in a small number of case reports [142], and might be considered if no other options exist.\nPortopulmonary hypertension Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) is the occurrence of PAH in the setting of portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient >5 mmHg or indirect signs of portal hypertension). While most PoPH patients also have cirrhosis, PoPH can occur without cirrhosis and across all Child Pugh classes [143]. The prevalence of PoPH in patients with cirrhosis or portal hypertension is not insignificant, accounting for  5 15% of all patients with PAH in the United States of America, France and Japan [144 147]. Conversely, the prevalence of PAH in patients with portal hypertension is reported to be between 2% and 6% [147 149].\nThe management of PoPH is unique. Prior to initiating treatment, it is important to distinguish true PoPH from other forms of PH that can occur in liver disease, including PH due to volume overload and/or high cardiac output states. Patients with PoPH will generally meet group 1 PAH haemodynamic criteria including a pulmonary artery wedge pressure  15 mmHg, but some degree of volume excess and high cardiac output may also be present and can complicate diagnosis. Optimising both volume state and treating the underlying liver disease are both important components of therapy.\nRegarding PAH pharmacotherapy, the PORTICO study, utilising macitentan, is the only RCT with a placebo-controlled, double-blind design specifically targeting PoPH. This study compared PVR after 12 weeks of macitentan 10 mg versus placebo, finding a 35% reduction in PVR with macitentan [13]. Other smaller studies, mostly open-label case series, have shown improvement versus baseline for PoPH with other PAH therapies including greater improvement in haemodynamics with the use of two- and three-drug combination therapy [150 152]. Overall numbers of patients are low, particularly for Child  Pugh grade C disease. For those with more advanced liver disease, caution is recommended due to the higher potential for impaired drug metabolism.\nA subset of patients with PoPH may be candidates for liver transplantation, and in observational studies, patients undergoing PAH medical therapy followed by liver transplantation have better survival rates versus PAH medical therapy alone [151, 153]. Haemodynamic targets prior to consideration of listing, as suggested by the International Liver Transplantation Society, include a mPAP <35 mmHg and a PVR <5 WU, or a mPAP 35 45 mmHg with a PVR <3 WU [152, 154]. These values are slightly more lenient than those utilised in earlier years. Pressures higher than this are generally considered an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation. Following liver transplant, PAH usually no longer progresses and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n12\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\nsome PAH patients have tolerated de-escalation or discontinuation of PAH therapies, but this is not universal [155].\nSchistosomiasis Schistosomiasis-associated PAH (Sch-PAH) is one of the most common causes of PAH worldwide [156, 157]. While Sch-PAH typically occurs in the setting of severe hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, the overall pathophysiology, prognosis and treatment response appear distinct from PoPH, albeit incompletely studied [156, 158]. Treatment with PAH therapies is associated with improvement in survival, with most reports describing treatment with PDE-5i or ERA monotherapy or combination therapy [159, 160]. Treatment of the underlying parasitic infection is also considered in all or some patients, although a haemodynamic benefit has not been established [159].\nPVOD/PCH PVOD/PCH represents a rare variant of PAH, distinguished by remodelling of the pulmonary venules and capillaries. Although PVOD/PCH and PAH share a similar clinical presentation with features of severe pre-capillary PH, it is important to differentiate these two conditions, as PVOD/PCH carries a worse prognosis and life-threatening pulmonary oedema may occur following the initiation of PAH therapy [47, 161 165]. To date, there is a lack of established evidence-based medical therapy for PVOD/PCH, making lung transplantation the preferred definitive treatment is strongly recommended that patients receive early referral to specialised centres upon diagnosis [72, 166].\nfor eligible patients.\nIt\nThe safety and efficacy of PAH-targeted drugs in the context of PVOD remain uncertain. Consequently, their use should be approached with great caution and limited to PH expert centres experienced in managing this complex condition.\nA recent systematic review evaluating the safety and efficacy of PAH-targeted treatments in PVOD/PCH identified 14 single case reports, no RCTs and four case series involving between eight and 16 patients. These reports included patients treated with CCBs, ERAs, PDE-5i and low-dose parenteral epoprostenol, mostly as monotherapy [167]. While moderate clinical and haemodynamic improvement was reported in some individual cases, sustained long-term effects are generally lacking [166].\nLimited-resource settings Unfortunately, access to PH medications may be limited in some areas, whether due to a lack of resources in general or due to inequitable distribution of resources/healthcare coverage, as is even seen in some wealthier countries. Generally, symptomatic management with diuretics and general and supportive measures are universally available options. Unfortunately, the cost and national availability of PH medication makes use impossible for many, and monotherapy a default approach in others. Parenteral therapies are generally not available where resources are limited. On a positive note, the approval of generic medications for some types of PAH therapies is welcomed. Advocacy programmes by the broader PH community for access to cheaper and effective generics as well as education on approaches to PH where resources are limited are recommended. Atrial septostomy has shown significant benefit in PAH, most notably where access to medications is limited, but, unfortunately, familiarity with the procedure is uncommon globally [168].\nHaemodynamic effects of PAH therapies Medications other than sotatercept have both acute and chronic vasodilatory effects [169, 170]. Acutely, the decline in mPAP and PVR in response to PAH medications is often modest, presumably due to the extensive vascular remodelling that is observed long-term [171], and combination therapy leads to greater haemodynamic improvement versus monotherapy, particularly when given as upfront therapy. The largest overall declines in PVR have been reported for upfront triple combination therapy that includes a parenteral PPA [3].\nis often present\nin PAH. Greater haemodynamic improvement\nSignificant improvement in right atrial pressure (RAP), mPAP, PVR, cardiac index and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), among others, have been reported in clinical trials and observational studies [3, 172]. As nonselective vasodilators, PAH therapies also lead to modest declines in systemic vascular resistance [173]. Clinically significant decreases in systemic blood pressure are uncommon, but can be seen when PAH therapies are used in combination, or with use of riociguat, which appears to have more potent systemic effects [22].\nIn contrast, sotatercept also leads to long-term improvements in pulmonary haemodynamics, but it lacks acute vasodilatory effects in the pulmonary or systemic circulation, suggesting that long-term improvements\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n13\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\nin haemodynamics occur through other mechanisms. Significant improvements in RAP, mPAP, PVR and SvO2, but not cardiac index, have been seen in sotatercept clinical trials [7, 12].\nThe reasons for the lack of improvement in cardiac index are unclear, but sotatercept also leads to increases in haemoglobin and systemic vascular resistance, both of which would theoretically reduce the tendency for cardiac output to increase, and have been hypothesised to contribute to this finding. In addition, all patients in the sotatercept studies were on background PAH medications, and many had a cardiac index in the normal range at baseline. Conversely, even when looking at the subgroup of patients in the sotatercept studies with a low cardiac index, a statistically significant increase in cardiac index was not seen, although a small (nonsignificant) numeric increase was reported [82]. What this means from a clinical standpoint is improvements in right not yet completely clear, as sotatercept ventricular function on imaging, a lower NT-proBNP and clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life and exercise capacity.\nleads to a robust reduction in PVR,\nStill, in patients presenting seriously ill and with a low cardiac index, the far greater experience with parenteral PPA in this setting suggests that these medications remain first-line. Rapid and pronounced improvement has been documented, including an early mortality benefit in the sickest patients [35].\nMedication administration and adverse effects More detailed information on the dosing and management of PAH therapies can be reviewed in prior WSPH publications and PH treatment guidelines [47, 48]. Medications and common adverse effects by pharmaceutical class are shown in table 2 [7, 8, 11, 18 27, 29 31, 33 36].\nWhile most adverse events can be managed with supportive therapy and/or dose adjustment, when applicable, a few require special consideration. Volume overload is common in PAH as a part of the disease process, but can also develop in response to PAH therapies, particularly with the ERAs. Management follow-up, adjusting diuretics, and occasionally discontinuation and transition to other medications. This effect tends to be magnified in patients with group 2 risk factors, and severe fluid retention with ERAs should prompt review of the overall PH diagnosis.\ninvolves frequent\nNew or worsened hypoxia related to PAH therapy is not common based on clinical trial data, despite the potential for increased ventilation/perfusion mismatch with PAH medications seen in experimental studies [174].\nIn those developing more severe hypoxia, echocardiography with bubble study and high-resolution computed tomography should be considered, and if no other causes are identified, previously unrecognised PVOD/PCH, although rare, should be considered. Typical findings suggestive of PVOD/PCH include the development of new hypoxia in combination with increased septal lines and/or ground-glass opacities on imaging following the introduction of PAH therapies, as well as mediastinal adenopathy.\nFor sotatercept, the most recently approved PAH therapy, treatment is initiated at 0.3 mg kg 1, and then increased to 0.7 mg kg 1 for subsequent doses administered every 3 weeks. Downtitration to 0.3 mg kg 1 can be considered when required for adverse events (particularly for elevated haemoglobin) or tolerability. Monitoring is recommended for increased haemoglobin, reduced platelets and the development of new telangiectasias, and an increased risk of bleeding events has been seen in trials. In addition, sotatercept carries a risk of fetal harm, and may have the potential to reduce future fertility and males and females, based on animal studies [175].\nParenteral PPAs and transitions between parenteral and nonparenteral PPAs Parenteral PPAs are initiated at 1 2 ng kg 1 min 1 for both epoprostenol and treprostinil, followed by uptitration over weeks to months, typically to an initial dose of 15 20 ng kg 1 min 1 for epoprostenol [35, 173, 176, 177] and  40 ng kg 1 min 1 for [178, 179]. Additional uptitration may be treprostinil considered if needed, but there is considerable variability across centres [178]. Higher targets are also advocated by some centres, mainly in Japan [180, 181]. Haemodynamic reassessment prior to additional dose escalation is recommended in order to avoid excessive side-effects as well as the potential for overdose and high cardiac output state [173, 182, 183].\nTransitions between epoprostenol and treprostinil and/or changes in route of delivery between subcutaneous and intravenous administration may be required due to delivery-route complications (site pain, line infections) or other reasons. Transitions should be performed with close monitoring. There is no established dose conversion formula, but in general, higher doses of treprostinil relative to epoprostenol are\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n14\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M. CHIN ET AL.\nutilised [184]. Acutely, modest under-dosing is preferred to over-dosing, such that many studies have utilised a relatively lower initial short-term transition target followed by a higher (outpatient) target based on tolerability and clinical response [185 191].\nTransitions from parenteral PPAs to oral or inhaled PPA are also considered in some patients, often at patient request and usually in patients with a good response to current therapy (PVR <5 WU, normal cardiac index, low-risk findings). With the increasing armamentarium of PAH therapies, requests for this type of transition may increase in the coming years. However, while short-term case series describe mostly positive outcomes, these data are very limited with some patients worsening during or after the transition, and with a poor response to reinitiation of the parenteral PPA in some cases [192, 193].\nFor those choosing to proceed, downtitration of epoprostenol or treprostinil is typically completed over weeks to months. Many centres utilise catheterisation during downtitration while still on a very low dose of epoprostenol or treprostinil and/or at the time of discontinuation, and again 3 4 months following transition [193 195]. More rapid downtitration is also possible, particularly for transitions to oral treprostinil [196], but requires particularly careful management. Initiation of the oral or inhaled PPA often occurs during the parenteral therapy downtitration, most often with overlap of the two medications for a short time.\nShared decision-making Before therapy is prescribed for a patient with PAH, a patient clinician discussion should occur to promote shared decision-making. Topics discussed should include information on the underlying disease process(es), benefits of potential therapies, route of administration and administration burden, adverse effect profile, any medication interactions, comorbidities and patient preferences [197].\nIt is important during this process to ask the patient about their preferred level of participation in treatment decision-making, as some prefer a much more active role, while others prefer to leave decisions almost entirely to their physicians [198]. Decision-making is aided by an understanding of the patient s most important treatment goals, whether improvement in prognosis, improvement in symptoms, avoidance of burdensome therapies, other goals, or all of the above.\nKnowledge gaps and future directions (cid:129)\nIn acute vasodilator responders with subsequent loss of response, it remains unknown whether CCBs should be continued, dosage reduced or discontinued. Studies on treatment response for patients with mPAP 21 24 mmHg and PVR 2 3 WU and for those with exercise PH are needed, as there is a paucity of clinic trial information.\n(cid:129)\n(cid:129) While combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy, additional studies on the timing and\nsequence of subsequent therapy escalation and optimal treatment goals are needed.\n(cid:129) High-quality observational data may be of use to help to supplement clinical trial data, particularly for newer therapies and to assess safety; registries should strive to enhance phenotyping, to include patients across different medications, and particular attention should be paid to transitions between therapies including intravenous/subcutaneous PPA. There remains concern that progressive subclinical deterioration in right ventricular function can occur despite favourable early clinical measures. Finding reliable markers of progression and response to escalation in therapies remains an important focus of research. (cid:129) Interventions to increase the acceptance and timing of initiation of parenteral prostacyclins are needed.

Exceptions include IPAH/HPAH/DT-PAH with a positive vasodilator response who should receive a CCB initially. Maximal medical therapy is now four-drug therapy. Reassessment and early escalation in therapy is recommended.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01325-2024\n15\nEUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL\n7TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON PULMONARY HYPERTENSION | K.M.
