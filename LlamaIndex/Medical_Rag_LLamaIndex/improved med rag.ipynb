By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, AI can help radiologists and clinicians to identify subtle patterns and anomalies in medical images that may not be apparent to the human eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key area where AI has made a notable impact is in the detection of abnormalities, such as tumors or lesions, in medical images. AI-powered algorithms can analyze large datasets of medical images and identify patterns that are indicative of disease. This can lead to earlier detection and diagnosis, which is critical in many medical conditions.\n",
      "\n",

In children, PAH is often associated with underlying conditions such as congenital heart defects, and treatment approaches may need to take these conditions into account. Additionally, children may require more aggressive and tailored treatment strategies to address their unique needs and developmental stages.\n",

      "In contrast, adults with PAH often have more established disease and may require a more nuanced approach to treatment, taking into account their individual risk factors, comorbidities, and quality of life. Treatment decisions for adults may also be influenced by their ability to adhere to complex medication regimens and their overall health status.\n",
