      "3. **Build emergency savings**: The report highlights the importance of having emergency savings to cover unexpected expenses. Households should aim to save at least three to six months' worth of living expenses to provide a financial safety net.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Improve credit outcomes**: The report shows that credit outcomes and perceptions can impact financial well-being. Households should focus on improving their credit scores by paying bills on time, reducing debt, and checking their credit reports for errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Invest in retirement**: The report emphasizes the need for households to plan for retirement. This could include contributing to a 401(k) or IRA, seeking professional financial advice, and creating a comprehensive retirement plan.\n",
