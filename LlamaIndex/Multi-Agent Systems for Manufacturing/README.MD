- **Real-Time IoT Integration**: Fetches live sensor data from **ThingSpeak** (vibration, temperature, operational hours).
- **Dynamic Document Creation**: Generates documents from real-time data for context-aware querying.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Uses **ReAct agents** to handle quality control, maintenance, and operational monitoring.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides maintenance recommendations based on sensor data.
- **Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms**: Ensures robust data fetching and processing.

  - Uses **quality control** and **maintenance** data as sample documents.
  - Implements **ReAct agents** for query routing and decision-making.
  - Adds **metadata filtering** for high-severity defects.
- **Files**:
  - `Multi-Agent Systems for Manufacturing.ipynb`

### **Phase 2: Real-Time IoT Integration**

- **Goal**: Build a **production-grade system** with real-time data.
- **Implementation**:
  - Fetches live sensor data from **ThingSpeak** (vibration, temperature, operational hours).
  - Creates **dynamic documents** from real-time data.
  - Provides **actionable insights** (e.g., maintenance recommendations).
  - Adds **error handling** and **retry mechanisms** for robust data fetching.
- **Files**:
  - `BetterVer.ipynb`

## Installation üíª

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Groq API key (set in `.env` file)
- ThingSpeak API keys (set in `.env` file)

### Steps

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Add your API keys to a `.env` file:

   ```ini
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   CHANNEL_ID_IOT=your_channel_id_here
   READ_KEY_IOT=your_read_key_here
   WRITE_KEY_IOT=your_write_key_here
   ```

3. Run the project:

   ```bash
   BetterVer.ipynb
   ```

## Usage üöÄ

### Running the Project

1. Start the interactive query system:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter your manufacturing questions. For example:

   ```bash
   Enter your question: Machine X is showing increased vibration. Should we schedule maintenance?
   ```

3. The system will:
   - Fetch real-time sensor data from **ThingSpeak**.
   - Generate **dynamic documents** from the data.
   - Provide **actionable insights** using **ReAct agents**.
